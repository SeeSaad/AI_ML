Adventure & Society pulls together the threads of these discourses into one coherent treatment of the term ‘adventure’ and the role that it plays in human social life of the 21st century. It explores how these practices can be considered more deeply through theoretical discourses of capitalism identity construction technology and social media risk-taking personal development equalities and sustainability. As such the book speaks to a broad audience of undergraduate and postgraduate students across diverse subject areas and aims to be an accessible starting point for deeper inquiry.

In Adventure Capitalist legendary investor Jim Rogers dubbed “the Indiana Jones of finance” by Time magazine proves that the best way to profit from the global situation is to see the world mile by mile. “While I have never patronized a prostitute” he writes “I know that one can learn more about a country from speaking to the madam of a brothel or a black marketeer than from meeting a foreign minister.” Behind the wheel of a sunburst-yellow custom-built convertible Mercedes Rogers and his fiancée Paige Parker began their “Millennium Adventure” on January 1 1999 from Iceland.

The Classic Fantasy Collection,Fantasy,Epic romances fearsome dragons and alien worlds lie between the pages of this volume. Containing more than 35 stories from the early masters of fantasy literature the narratives here transport the reader to alternate worlds where magic abounds cosmic terrors lie around the corner and intrepid heroes fight for justice. Drawing inspiration from Norse Japanese and Chinese mythology as well as from traditional fairytales and modern fears the authors collected here span the breadth of the genre. Including tales from William Morris H. G. Wells Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft amongst others they demonstrate the plethora of imaginative literature that was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these tales were foundational works bringing ideas of the supernatural into the mainstream and through their efforts creating entirely new genres. Before Tolkien there were many writers embracing the realm of fantastic fiction. The man responsible for its origin was George MacDonald (1824-1905) a Calvinist minister and Celtic scholar who wrote the first true fantasy novel. He was followed by a number of imaginative successors at the end of the 19th century including H. G. Wells Arthur Machen and Ernest Bramah. After the end of World War I the pulp magazines opened up the genre to a new generation of writers - particularly H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard - who provided exciting magical and horrifying tales that fascinated a multitude of readers. By the outbreak of World War II the outlines of the fantasy genre had been sketched out by these pioneers and an entirely new type of fiction had been created.

In this first critical book in its time on modern English fantasy Colin Manlove surveys a representative group of modern fantasies--in the Victorian period in the children's scientific and Christian fantasy The Water-Babies by Charles Kingsley and the mystical fantasy of the Scottish writer George MacDonald; and from the twentieth century the interplanetary romances of C. S. Lewis the post-war fantasy of rebellious youth in Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast books and the quest to avert apocalypse in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The aim with all these works is to show the peculiar literary experiences they offer and to assess their strengths and limitations in relation to wider English literature. In the introduction to his book Manlove gives a definition of fantasy marking off the genre from its near neighbors science fiction and ""Gothic"" or horror story and distinguishing between fantasies that are serious works of imagination and those that are fanciful or escapist. Each chapter that follows is primarily a literary analysis set in a context of the writer's life thought and other works. As the book proceeds there begins to emerge a picture of the originality and merit of the writers but at the same time the sense of a division in the purpose of each writer whereby their works fail to abide by their own laws. In the conclusion to this book Manlove draws the different types of division found into one and argues that the problem is one that is endemic to the writing of modern fantasy."

Here Be Dragons,Fantasy,First in-depth study of the use of landscape in fantasy literature Winner of the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Myth and Fantasy Studies (2016) Fantasy worlds are never mere backdrops. They are an integral part of the work and refuse to remain separate from other elements. These worlds combine landscape with narrative logic by incorporating alternative rules about cause and effect or physical transformation. They become actors in the drama—interacting with the characters offering assistance or hindrance and making ethical demands. In Here Be Dragons Stefan Ekman provides a wide-ranging survey of the ubiquitous fantasy map as the point of departure for an in-depth discussion of what such maps can tell us about what is important in the fictional worlds and the stories that take place there. With particular focus on J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings Ekman shows how fantasy settings deserve serious attention from both readers and critics. Includes insightful readings of works by Steven Brust Garth Nix Robert Holdstock Terry Pratchett Charles de Lint China Miéville Patricia McKillip Tim Powers Lisa Goldstein Steven R. Donaldson Robert Jordan and Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess.

Strictly Fantasy,Fantasy,"Role-playing games seemed to appear of nowhere in the early 1970s and have been a quiet but steady presence in American culture ever since. This new look at the hobby searches for the historical origins of role-playing games deep in the imaginative worlds of Western culture. It looks at the earliest fantasy stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries at the fans--both readers and writers--who wanted to bring them to life at the Midwestern landscape and the middle-class households that were the hobby's birthplace and at the struggle to find meaning and identity amidst cultural conflicts that drove many people into these communities of play. This book also addresses race religion gender fandom and the place these games have within American capitalism. All the paths of this journey are connected by the very quality that has made fantasy role-playing so powerful: it binds the limitless imagination into a ""strict"" framework of rules. Far from being an accidental offshoot of marginalized fan communities role-playing games' ability to hold contradictions in dynamic creative tension made them a necessary and central product of the twentieth century."

Fantasy Literature and Christianity,Fantasy,The debate surrounding the Christian aspects of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia J.R.R.

As the two story systems that have been humanity's most advanced technologies for collective dreaming fantastic fiction and myths are helping us adopt a biocentric lens re-kin us with other forms of life and assist us in the transition to an ecological civilization.

A Phylogenetic Fantasy,Fantasy,"This volume heralds the appearance for the first time in many years of a totally new document by Sigmund Freud. It is the draft of a lost metapsychological paper one of twelve essays written during World War I at the peak of the master's powers. Freud intended to publish all twelve in book form under the title Preliminaries to a Metapsychology and thereby set out the theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis. Scholars have long lamented the disappearance without a trace of seven of these important essays. Only in 1983 did Ilse Grubrich-Simitis happen upon this draft in Freud's handwriting in an old trunk containing papers and documents of his Hungarian collaborator Sándor Ferenczi. With the help of a brief letter Freud had written on the back of the last page she soon realized that the manuscript she had found was the draft of the final paper in the series. That draft is published here in facsimile together with a transcription in German of the facsimile and the English translation. In the first part of the draft which is written in a kind of shorthand Freud contrasts the three classic transference neuroses: anxiety hysteria conversion hysteria and obsessional neurosis. In the second part which is written in complete sentences Freud undertakes a daringly speculative ""phylogenetic fantasy"" He explores whether the debilitating illnesses of the neurotic and the psychotic today might have originated long ago as adaptive responses of the entire species to threatening environmental changes or to traumatic events in the prehistory of mankind. In the draft ""Fantasy"" Freud modifies and expands the line of reasoning he began in Totem and Taboo (1912-13) after an intensely productive exchange with Ferenczi about Lamarckian concepts making this recovered draft of major significance to students not only of psychoanalysis but also of the social sciences humanities and natural sciences. Ilse Grubrich-Simitis has contributed a detailed essay setting the overview in the context of Freud's life his work and his historical and scientific prominence. She quotes from relevant letters of Freud and Ferenczi some published here for the first time."
The Story of the Glittering Plain (1891) (fantasy) NOVEL By: William Morris,Fantasy,The Story of the Glittering Plain (full title: The Story of the Glittering Plain which has been also called the Land of Living Men or the Acre of the Undying) is an 1891 fantasy novel by William Morris perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. It is also important for its exploration of the socialist themes that interested Morris. His earlier fantasies The House of the Wolfings and The Roots of the Mountains were to some degree historical novels. Like these The Story of the Glittering Plain is set in a world similar to the distant past of northern Europe. Morris would go on to develop the new genre established in this work in such later fantasies as Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair The Wood Beyond the World The Well at the World's End and The Water of the Wondrous Isles.

Lacanian Fantasy,Fantasy,Lacanian Fantasy: The Image Language and Uncertainty addresses the question of how fantasy developed as a psychological concept particularly as influenced by Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. Kirk Turner moves thematically from childhood to adulthood and chronologically from Freud's earliest theories to Lacan's most complex statements on fantasy towards the end of his career. He explores not only the variations that the concept has undergone throughout its history - from Ancient Greek discourse around phantasia to the present day - but also the changing consequences of its applications. Lacanian Fantasy includes further insights on our current predicament: the age of the social media image and fantasy in the uncertain 'locked down' world of a pandemic.

Between Culture and Fantasy,Fantasy,The myths of the Gimi a people of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea attribute the origin of death and misery to the incestuous desires of the first woman or man as if one sex or the other were guilty of the very first misdeed. Working for years among the Gimi speaking their language anthropologist Gillian Gillison gained rare insight into these myths and their pervasive influence in the organization of social life. Hers is a fascinating account of relations between the sexes and the role of myth in the transition between unconscious fantasy and cultural forms. Gillison shows how the themes expressed in Gimi myths—especially sexual hostility and an obsession with menstrual blood—are dramatized in the elaborate public rituals that accompany marriage death and other life crises. The separate myths of Gimi women and men seem to speak to one another to protest alter and enlarge upon myths of the other sex. The sexes cast blame in the veiled imagery of myth and then play out their debate in joint rituals cooperating in shows of conflict and resolution that leave men undefeated and accord women the greater blame for misfortune.

Memory Myth and Seduction,Fantasy,Memory Myth and Seduction reveals the development and evolution of Jean-Georges Schimek's thinking on unconscious fantasy and the interpretive process derived from a close reading of Freud as well as contemporary psychoanalysis. Contributing richly to North American psychoanalytic thought Schimek challenges local views from the perspective of continental discourse. A practicing psychoanalyst teacher and consummate Freud scholar Schimek sought to clarify Freud's concepts and theories and to disentangle complexities borne of inconsistencies in Freud's assumptions and expositions. This book is divided thematically into three sections. The first concerns fantasy and interpretation as they play out in the analytic situation and the manner in which analyst and patient coconstruct meaning and reconstruct and recover memory. The second consists of two seminal papers which provide the sequence of steps in the five revisions in Freud's seduction theory. Schimek's careful scholarship lays out the data of Freud's writing which allows one to draw one's own conclusions about the implications of the changes in the theory that he made. In the third more theoretical section he provides a foundation for understanding many of today's discussions about unconscious fantasy dreaming remembering consciousness affect self-reflection mentalization and implicit relational knowing. He clarifies and illustrates Freud's original formulations (and their inherent problems) through a careful reading of sections of The Interpretation of Dreams and a study of Freud's famous Signorelli parapraxis. Skillfully arranged and carefully edited by Deborah Browning and including a foreword by Alan Bass this collection of Schimek's published and unpublished papers will be of interest to practicing psychoanalysts psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapists and students of the history of ideas and philosophy who have a particular interest in fantasy interpretation and Freud.

The Anatomy of National Fantasy,Fantasy,"Examining the complex relationships between the political popular sexual and textual interests of Nathaniel Hawthorne's work Lauren Berlant argues that Hawthorne mounted a sophisticated challenge to America's collective fantasy of national unity. She shows how Hawthorne's idea of citizenship emerged from an attempt to adjudicate among the official and the popular the national and the local the collective and the individual utopia and history. At the core of Berlant's work is a three-part study of The Scarlet Letter analyzing the modes and effects of national identity that characterize the narrator's representation of Puritan culture and his construction of the novel's political present tense. This analysis emerges from an introductory chapter on American citizenship in the 1850s and a following chapter on national fantasy ranging from Hawthorne's early work ""Alice Doane's Appeal"" to the Statue of Liberty. In her conclusion Berlant suggests that Hawthorne views everyday life and local political identities as alternate routes to the revitalization of the political and utopian promises of modern national life."

Lilith (1895). by George MacDonald,Fantasy,"Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald and first published in 1895. Its importance was recognized in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1969.Lilith is considered among the darkest of MacDonald's works and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life death and salvation. In the story MacDonald mentions a cosmic sleep that heals tortured souls preceding the salvation of all. MacDonald was a Christian universalist believing that all will eventually be saved. However in this story divine punishment is not taken lightly and salvation is hard-won.Mr. Vane the protagonist of Lilith owns a library that seems to be haunted by the former librarian who looks much like a raven from the brief glimpses he catches of the wraith. After finally encountering the supposed ghost the mysterious Mr. Raven Vane learns that Raven had known his father; indeed Vane's father had visited the strange parallel universe from which Raven comes and goes and now resides therein. Vane follows Raven into the world through a mirror (this symbolistic realm is described as ""the region of the seven dimensions"" a term taken from Jacob Boehme). Inside the world Vane learns of a house of beds where the dreamers sleep until the end of the world in death: a good death in which life is found. Vane's grandfather refused to sleep there and is instead forced to do battle with skeletons in a haunted wood. After a treacherous journey through a valley (where the moon is the only thing to keep him safe) Mr. Vane meets the Little Ones children who never grow up remaining pure children or becoming selfish and getting bigger and dumber turning into ""bags"" or bad giants. After conversing with Lona the eldest of the children Mr. Vane decides to help them and sets off to gather more information although the Raven (who is also Adam) has warned Mr. Vane that he needs to sleep along with the dreamers before he can really help them. While on his journey he meets Lilith Adam's first wife and the princess of Bulika. Vane although nearly blinded by Lilith's beauty and charms eventually leads the Little Ones in a battle against Bulika. Lona Vane's love turns out to be Lilith's daughter and is killed by her own mother. Lilith however is captured and brought to Adam and Eve at the house of death where they struggle to make her open her hand fused shut in which she holds the water the Little Ones need to grow. Only when she gives it up can Lilith join the sleepers in blissful dreams free of sin. After a long struggle Lilith bids Adam cut her hand from her body; it is done Lilith sleeps and Vane is sent to bury the hand; water flows from the hole and washes the land over. Vane is then allowed to join the Little Ones already asleep in their dreaming. He takes his bed next to Lona's and finds true life in death...."

Fashion Faith and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe,Fantasy,"Nobel Prize–winning physicist Roger Penrose questions some of the most fashionable ideas in physics today including string theory What can fashionable ideas blind faith or pure fantasy possibly have to do with the scientific quest to understand the universe? Surely theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends dogmatic beliefs or flights of fancy? In fact acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else. In this provocative book he argues that fashion faith and fantasy while sometimes productive and even essential in physics may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas—string theory quantum mechanics and cosmology. Arguing that string theory has veered away from physical reality by positing six extra hidden dimensions Penrose cautions that the fashionable nature of a theory can cloud our judgment of its plausibility. In the case of quantum mechanics its stunning success in explaining the atomic universe has led to an uncritical faith that it must also apply to reasonably massive objects and Penrose responds by suggesting possible changes in quantum theory. Turning to cosmology he argues that most of the current fantastical ideas about the origins of the universe cannot be true but that an even wilder reality may lie behind them. Finally Penrose describes how fashion faith and fantasy have ironically also shaped his own work from twistor theory a possible alternative to string theory that is beginning to acquire a fashionable status to ""conformal cyclic cosmology"" an idea so fantastic that it could be called ""conformal crazy cosmology."" The result is an important critique of some of the most significant developments in physics today from one of its most eminent figures."

Bread of Dreams,Fantasy,"In a rich and engaging book that illuminates the lives and attitudes of peasants in preindustrial Europe Piero Camporesi makes the unexpected and fascinating claim that these people lived in a state of almost permanent hallucination drugged by their very hunger or by bread adulterated with hallucinogenic herbs. The use of opiate products administered even to infants and children was widespread and was linked to a popular mythology in which herbalists and exorcists were important cultural figures. Through a careful reconstruction of the everyday lives of peasants beggars and the poor Camporesi presents a vivid and disconcerting image of early modern Europe as a vast laboratory of dreams. ""Camporesi is as much a poet as a historian. . . . His appeal is to the senses as well as to the mind. . . . Fascinating in its details and compelling in its overall message.""—Vivian Nutton Times Literary Supplement ""It is not often that an academic monograph in history is also a book to fascinate the discriminating general reader. Bread of Dreams is just that.""—Kenneth McNaught Toronto Star ""Not religion but bread was the opiate of the poor Mr. Camporesi argues. . . . Food has always been a social and mythological construct that conditions what we vainly imagine to be matters of personal taste. Our hunger for such works should tell us that food is not only good but essential to think and to read as if our lives depended on it which they do.""—Betty Fussell New York Times Book Review"

Honig focuses on a number of major works that are representative of the best of their era--including such classics as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll; The Golden Key The Princess and the Goblin and others by George MacDonald; the works of Mary Louisa Molesworth; Peter and Wendy by James Barrie; The Five Children and Itand The Enchanted Castle by Edith Nesbit. Through a close reading of these fantasies Honig demonstrates that although Victorian women were still being repressed in the home and the marketplace the female figure in literature played a role that was quite different from the traditional stereotype of the meek submissive wife and mother.
Mission Improbable,Fantasy,"How does the U.S. Post Office plan to deliver mail after atomic Armageddon? How do oil industry executives intend to collect 10 million gallons of oil spilled in the Gulf of Alaska? How do regulators try to convince people that everyone can be evacuated from congested Long Island after a nuclear power plant destroys itself? Lee Clarke enters the world of managers and experts to find out how governments and corporations plan for massive disaster when they have no clue as to how to go about it. He argues that managers create plans that are ""fantasy documents"" rhetorical tools that are used to convince audiences that experts are in charge and that all is well. Provocative and written for a general audience Mission Improbable makes the case that society would be safer smarter and fairer if organizations would admit their limitations."

Video Games Violence and the Ethics of Fantasy,Fantasy,Is it ever morally wrong to enjoy fantasizing about immoral things? Many video games allow players to commit numerous violent and immoral acts. But should players worry about the morality of their virtual actions? A common argument is that games offer merely the virtual representation of violence. No one is actually harmed by committing a violent act in a game. So it cannot be morally wrong to perform such acts. While this is an intuitive argument it does not resolve the issue. Focusing on why individual players are motivated to entertain immoral and violent fantasies Video Games Violence and the Ethics of Fantasy advances debates about the ethical criticism of art not only by shining light on the interesting and under-examined case of virtual fantasies but also by its novel application of a virtue ethical account. Video games are works of fiction that enable players to entertain a fantasy. So a full understanding of the ethical criticism of video games must focus attention on why individual players are motivated to entertain immoral and violent fantasies. Video Games Violence and the Ethics of Fantasy engages with debates and critical discussions of games in both the popular media and recent work in philosophy psychology media studies and game studies.

Feminist Alternatives,Fantasy,"The author contends that the novels of the period 1969--1988 served as a dialogue among women authors and their readers as they attempted to deal with dramatic alterations in attitudes toward career sexuality and continued tension between personal autonomy and cultural sexism. In readings of novels by American British and Canadian authors including Gail Godwin Toni Morrison Margaret Drabble Doris Lessing Maxine Hong Kingston and Margaret Atwood the author proposes that the narrative devices of irony and fantasy that are used commonly in these novels reflect women's increased detachment from cultural attempts to define women's nature and role and their needs to imagine alternative ways of ordering their own lives and the structure of society itself. Rather than a chronological or author-by-author study this insightful book integrates references to and readings of the novels in several areas of emphasis: the novel as a means of communication among women of this period the relationship between irony and fantasy as narrative elements and the authors' concern with language itself the novelists' tendency to use multiple narrative voices that continuously revise the concept of a fixed ""self"" and the stories that have traditionally defined the female self the use of dreams fantasies and even madness as means of transcendence and the frequent creation of utopian or dystopian visions of past or future. The author concludes that a pervasive theme in women's novels of the past twenty years from Lessing's The Four--Gated City to Atwood's Cat's Eye is the radical questioning of received tradition. She concludes as well that the alternative society collectively envisioned by these would value women's intellectual as well emotional powers recognize their sexuality reformulate the concept of power and recognize women's full participation in the creation of language and meaning."

Herein are fascinating and obscure details which are the result of 25 years - and thousands of hours - of television viewing. How many rooms were there in the Clampett mansion in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and where was Granny's moonshine still in relation to the cement pond?

Challenging the Fantasy Bond,Fantasy,"""Why are many of us compelled to repeat the pain of our past while avoiding positive experiences that could enrich our lives? In this thought-provoking book clinical psychologist and theorist Robert Firestone explains how the fantasy bond an illusion of connection develops to protect us from negative experiences with parents or caregivers. Later in life the fantasy bond manifests itself in destructive internal voices and imagined connections to family members intimate partners and social groups. Compelling case studies illustrate how these negative voices interfere with true intimacy and demonstrate how Voice Therapy a cognitive/affective/behavioral methodology can be used to counteract destructive internal messages and help individuals embrace the present instead of living in the past. Challenging our illusions of a merged identity and moving toward separation and individuation are essential if we are to become fully autonomous human beings. This thorough update of a classic work is particularly timely because it also identifies existential fears that contribute to death anxiety prejudice and political divisiveness""--"
The Economics of Fantasy,Fantasy,In The Economics of Fantasy: Rape in Twentieth-Century Literature Sharon Stockton examines the persistence and the evolution of the rape narrative in twentieth-century literature--the old story of male power and violence; female passivity and penetrability. What accounts for its persistence? How has the story changed over the course of the twentieth century? In this provocative book Stockton investigates the manner in which the female body--or to be more precise the violation of the female body--serves as a metaphor for a complex synthesis of masculinity and political economy. From high modernism to cyberpunk Pound to Pynchon Stockton argues that the compulsive return to the rape story articulates--among other things--the gradual and relentless removal of Western man from the fantastical capitalist role of venturesome industrious agency. The metamorphosis of the twentieth-century rape narrative registers a desperate attempt to preserve traditional patterns of robust entrepreneurial masculinity in the face of economic forms that increasingly disallow illusions of individual authority. It is important to make clear that the genre of rape story studied here presumes a white masculine subject and a white feminine object. Stockton makes the case that the aestheticized rape narrative reveals particular things about the way white masculinity represents itself. Plotting violent sexual fantasy on the grid of economic concerns locates masculine agency in relation to an explicitly contingent material system of power value and order. It is in this way that The Economics of Fantasy discloses the increased desperation with which the body has been made to carry ideology under systems of advanced capitalism.
Discourse Desire and Fantasy in Jurgen Habermas' Critical Theory,Fantasy,This book argues that Jürgen Habermas’ critical theory can be productively developed by incorporating a wider understanding of fantasy and imagination as part of its conception of communicative rationality and communicative pathologies. Given that meaning is generated both linguistically and performatively MacKendrick argues that desire and fantasy must be taken into consideration as constitutive aspects of intersubjective relations. His aim is to show that Habermasian social theory might plausibly renew its increasingly severed ties with the early critical theory of the Frankfurt School by taking account of these features of practice life thus simultaneously rekindling the relevance of the nearly forgotten emancipatory intent in his earlier work and rejuvenating an emphasis on the contemporary critique of reason. This innovative new study will be of interest to those focusing on the early writings of Habermas the writings of the Frankfurt School and the relation between critical theory hermeneutics and psychoanalysis.

The book draws on qualitative research with undergraduate creative writing students and fills a gap in the literature exploring creative writing pedagogy and creative writing exercises.

This innovative work offers fresh insights for scholars of creativity Lacan and psychosocial studies and a valuable new resource for students and teachers of creative writing.

Fantasy Nude Photography,Fantasy,Of the many different types of fine art photography fantasy nudes are among the more creative and daring. Since we’re dealing in fantasy anything is possible. It’s not necessary to travel to exotic locales for a shoot or for that matter limit yourself to locales that exist at all! With a little imagination simple lighting arrangements and some computer postproduction it’s possible to simulate location shoots create imagined locations or take a standard nude shot and make it into an exotic portrait. One of the benefits of creating images in this manner is that it frees the photographer up from needing a model to be in the right place at the right time. Working with preexisting nature or location shots it’s possible to photograph a model in the comfort of a studio and then combine the images by compositing. Kirby presents dozens of examples where he employed this method to great success. While creating fantastical and striking backgrounds are a big part of Kirby’s work thoughtful lighting plans when shooting the models is what makes the images really standout. He experiments with different ways of using his lights sometimes creating his own DIY lighting units and shares the details throughout the book. Matching the light in the studio to the light of the imagined location is imperative. Each photo in the book has an explanation of the concept for the image details on the execution of the shoot and a lighting diagram. In addition the images are also accompanied by alternate photos or before-and-after shots. Not every image in the book is rooted in fantasy. There are dramatic studio portraits and unique nature shots all created in the same manner that Kirby employs for his fantasy shots. Working in this manner allows for more trouble-shooting options. Sometimes it is necessary to create an image under less than suitable conditions. For instance say your shoot requires a summery scene in mid-winter. In one of the lessons Kirby used a previously taken picture of a bright cloudy sky added lighting to the model as if the shoot were being done outdoors and photographed the model in front of blue screen allowing him the option to drop her into the landscape photo afterwards.
The Happiness Fantasy,Fantasy,"In this devastatingly witty new book Carl Cederström traces our present-day conception of happiness from its roots in early-twentieth-century European psychiatry to the Beat generation to Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. He argues that happiness is now defined by a desire to be ""authentic"" to experience physical pleasure and to cultivate a quirky individuality. But over the last fifty years these once-revolutionary ideas have been co-opted by corporations and advertisers pushing us to live lives that are increasingly unfulfilling insecure and narcissistic. In an age of increasing austerity and social division Cederström argues that a radical new dream of happiness is gathering pace. There is a vision of the good life which promotes deeper engagement with the world and our place within it over the individualism and hedonism of previous generations. Guided by this more egalitarian worldview we can reinvent ourselves and our societies."

Bill Gibb,Fantasy,"""Crowned Designer of the Year by British Vogue in 1970 Bill Gibb [1943-1988) was set to become a major name in fashion history. Famous for his love of romance Gibb's flamboyant flights of fancy appeared revolutionary in the 1970s and still have a resonance today. But his career came to an abrupt end in 1988 when the fashion industry lost one of its most adventurous and exciting designers. It seems a fitting time to review Gibb's contribution to fashion."" ""This stunning book explores the work of a prolific and at his best truly visionary designer: his background and the enduring themes that inspired his designs. Gibb's fashion philosophy is revealed through the words of the designer its effect on the fashion world seen through the eyes of those who knew him: industry professionals family and friends. Gibb was a free spirit an intuitive designer who broke the rules not only in terms of design but also concepts and attitudes. Ahead of his time he was aware of the value of celebrity endorsement and dressed rock stars actresses and film stars from Rod Stewart to Bianca Jagger and Elizabeth Taylor."" ""It sets up a dialogue between the fashion industry of the 1970s and the fashion world of today. Much of Gibb's output verged on couture. 'I strove for the top and achieved it within ten years' he once said. Illustrated with his detailed drawings intimate reportage-style snapshots previously unseen catwalk images and fashion plates by leading photographers this book is testimony to an individualist faithful to his own design principles who believed consummately in his 'rare gift ... to design beautiful clothes'.""--BOOK JACKET."
The Theological Landscape of Middle Earth,Fantasy,"""Fantasy may be a nice entertainment. But not only: fantasy can convey the deepest questions of human heart including religious and theological ones and responses expressed in the way which would not be possible in any other way namely through mythological archetypes and symbols. This book explores those contained in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy especially in ""The Lord of the Rings."""
Far-right Fantasy,Fantasy,"Far-Right Fantasy is a straight-forward jargon-free study of contemporary American right-wing extremism. Accessible to both professional and lay audiences it allows activists to speak for themselves in their own words. It takes the self-announced religious motivations of extremists seriously and illustrates this by citing numerous cases of radical politics. The book addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the standard psycho-social-cultural explanations of far-right activism. It shows how extremists are similar educationally and psychologically to their more conventional neighbors; that they get into the movement in the same way that others become peace activists or radical environmentalists namely through their ties with fellow workers and church-goers family members and classmates; and that their views are given a patina of certainty by being repeatedly corroborated within closed non-contaminated communication systems. The book avoids being preachy or judgmental but it does try to challenge readers morally by submitting far-right fantasy to a formal ideology critique. It does this by showing how the reforms it recommends - a marketplace free of regulation draconian immigration restrictions; an end to the federal reserve bank and the income tax; a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; anti-union ""right to work"" laws and a return to debt slavery; the privatization of schools the post office and the commons and so on - contradict its ostensible goal which is to protect and enhance middle class interests. Far-Right Fantasy is suitable for adoption as a supplemental text in political psychology and sociology sociologies of religion and knowledge collective behavior and American political history."

The History of the Science-fiction Magazine,Science Fiction,This is the first of three volumes that chart the history of the science fiction magazine from the earliest days to the present. This first volume looks at the exuberant years of the pulp magazines. It traces the growth and development of the science fiction magazines from when Hugo Gernsback launched the very first Amazing Stories in 1926 through to the birth of the atomic age and the death of the pulps in the early 1950s. These were the days of the youth of science fiction when it was brash raw and exciting: the days of the first great space operas by Edward Elmer Smith and Edmond Hamilton through the cosmic thought variants by Murray Leinster Jack Williamson and others to the early 1940s when John W. Campbell at Astounding did his best to nurture the infant genre into adulthood. Under him such major names as Robert A. Heinlein Isaac Asimov A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon emerged who along with other such new talents as Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke helped create modern science fiction. For over forty years magazines were at the heart of science fiction and this book considers how the magazines and their publishers editors and authors influenced the growth and perception of this fascinating genre.

Latin American Science Fiction Writers,Science Fiction,Many readers are unaware of the vast universe of Latin American science fiction which has its roots in the 18th century and has flourished to the present day.

Since much of science fiction has been written by women many women writers are profiled. Each entry is prepared by an expert contributor and includes a short biography a discussion of the writer's works and primary and secondary bibliographies. The volume closes with a general bibliography of anthologies and criticism.

Science Fiction: The Year's Best (2006 Edition),Science Fiction,"Horton's elegiac anthology of 15 mostly hard SF stories illuminates a broad spectrum of grief over love thwarted through time space human frailty or alien intervention from the gentle melancholy of Michael Swanwick's ""Triceratops Summer"" which posits tame Technicolored time-warped dinosaurs in Vermont to newcomer Leah Bobet's ""Bliss"" an agonizing riff on near-future drug addiction. Several selections address current political-social issues like Mary Rosenblum's ""Search Engine"" which extrapolates today's technology to chilling Big Brotherly results. The long closing story Alastair Reynolds's ""Understanding Space and Time"" however presents a ray of cosmic hope: the sole survivor of a plague that decimated humanity is rescued and healed by intergalactic entities and lives out millennia while seeking ultimate truths returning to see mankind regenerated. This anthology reflects the concerns of the genre today—and the apparent inability of our society to do anything about them. -- Publishers Weekly"

Reinventing Richard Nixon,Science Fiction,"""Examining Nixon's autobiographies and political memorabilia Frick offers far-reaching perceptions not only of the man but of Nixon's version of himself - contrasted with those who would interpret him differently. He cites reinventions of Nixon from the late 1980s particularly the museum at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace to demonstrate the resilience of certain national mythic narratives in the face of liberal critiques. And he recounts how celebrants at Nixon's state funeral at which Bob Dole's eulogy depicted a God-fearing American hero attempted to bury the sources of our divisions over him rendering in some minds the judgment of ""redeemed statesman"" to erase his status as ""disgraced president."""" ""With dozens of illustrations - Nixon posing with Elvis (the National Archives' most requested photo) Nixonian cultural artifacts classic editorial cartoons - no other book collects in one place such varied images of Nixon from so many diverse media. These reinforce Frick's probing analysis to help us understand why we disagree about Nixon - and why it matters how we resolve our disagreements.""--BOOK JACKET."

Pseudoscience and Science Fiction,Science Fiction,Aliens flying saucers ESP the Bermuda Triangle antigravity ... are we talking about science fiction or pseudoscience? Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference. Both pseudoscience and science fiction (SF) are creative endeavours that have little in common with academic science beyond the superficial trappings of jargon and subject matter. The most obvious difference between the two is that pseudoscience is presented as fact not fiction. Yet like SF and unlike real science pseudoscience is driven by a desire to please an audience – in this case people who “want to believe”. This has led to significant cross-fertilization between the two disciplines. SF authors often draw on “real” pseudoscientific theories to add verisimilitude to their stories while on other occasions pseudoscience takes its cue from SF – the symbiotic relationship between ufology and Hollywood being a prime example of this. This engagingly written well researched and richly illustrated text explores a wide range of intriguing similarities and differences between pseudoscience and the fictional science found in SF. Andrew May has a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a PhD in astrophysics from Manchester University. After many years in academia and the private sector he now works as a freelance writer and scientific consultant. He has written pocket biographies of Newton and Einstein as well as contributing to a number of popular science books. He has a lifelong interest in science fiction and has had several articles published in Fortean Times magazine

The Stuff of Science Fiction,Science Fiction,While students and general readers typically cannot relate to esoteric definitions of science fiction they readily understand the genre as a literature that characteristically deals with subjects such as new inventions space robot and aliens. This book looks at science fiction in precisely this manner with twenty-one chapters that each deal with a subject that is repeatedly addressed in science fiction of recent centuries. Based on a packet of original essays that the author assembled for his classes the book could serve as a supplemental textbook in science fiction classes but also contains material of interest to science fiction scholars and others devoted to the genre. In some cases chapters offer thorough surveys of numerous works involving certain subjects such as imagined vehicles journeys beneath the Earth and undersea adventures discovering intriguing patterns in the ways that various writers developed their ideas. When comprehensive coverage of ubiquitous topics such as robots aliens and the planet Mars is impossible chapters focus on major themes referencing selected texts. A conclusion discusses other science fiction subjects that were omitted for various reasons and a bibliography lists additional resources for the study of science fiction in general and the topics of each chapter.
The New Space Opera,Science Fiction,“This anthology is a reminder of why science fiction captured the hearts and minds of generations of readers.” —Orson Scott Card What sets space opera apart from other fiction is its sheer scale: it is an exuberant celebration of the very large and the very small of the very old and the very new of the vast panoramic instant we live in; the instant in which everything that went before melds with everything yet to be. It is Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. The only book of its kind The New Space Opera brings together for the first time the generation of writers who spawned and embody the “new space opera” as well as other talents destined to join their ranks. Going beyond everything that has come before this fresh visionary anthology is essential reading for every science fiction fan. “The new space opera shares with the old the interstellar sweep of events and exotic locales but Dozois and Strahan’s all-original anthology shows how the genre’s purveyors have updated it with rigorous science well-drawn characters and excellent writing.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review) “Dynamic and exciting . . . an essential roadmap to the cutting edge of SF today.” —Charles Stross “In sheer breathtaking mind-expanding scope this collection of some of the finest tale-spinning the subgenre has to offer delivers hours of exhilarating reading.” —Booklist

Science-Fiction as Genre of Possibilities. Social Criticism in a Limitless Range of Opportunities?,Science Fiction,Seminar paper from the year 2018 in the subject American Studies - Literature grade: 17 University of Würzburg (Neuphilologisches Institut) course: Science Fiction and Social Activism language: English abstract: This paper investigates if Octavia Butler’s Kindred is fitting into the overall definition of science fiction and if not why and how she is exaggerating the genre and its limits. There are different approaches available to analyze this content. For example one could work with a historical analysis of a genre presented in Cuddon/ Preston. On the other hand no investigation on history could prevent the paper from losing itself in trivialities of change. For this reason I will choose a mixed approach analyzing standard works dictionaries companions and specialist books on different branches of the genre to be able to summarize all parameters needed to form a profound definition. On the one hand the paper will therefore work quantitatively in sense of finding as much evidence as possible for each and every parameter. On the other hand I am going to work qualitatively in sense of investigating one special example (Kindred) regarding the overall contemplation. Although the paper could never reach representativeness the selection of possible classifications and definitions is highly important as they shape the paper’s outcome and final conclusion. For this reason writers from both sides of the ocean shall be taken into consideration as they influenced the genre in a wide extent for example in creating the progression of the »New Wave« and therefore might be important for the paper too. Assuming that the paper is going to deal with the genre itself not authors in particular. A distinct theory is not needed as the structure is set up to be a theoretical one analyzing the content of a genre and hence works on theoretical constructs itself. Nevertheless postmodernism will be of a great importance which will be both introduced and explained in the following chapters. The paper will be organized in an introduction presenting the topic research question and thesis. Next to that is chapter two containing definitions in which parameters from research are being listed to be able to set a definition. Chapter three changes to social criticism in SF and explores why Kindred is social criticism in the first place and investigates if it fits into the definition found in chapter two. Part four will merge the two lines of action and set a new and overall definition. It will answer the research question if and how Octavia Butler’s Kindred is exaggerating the definition and verifies or falsifies the thesis.

The War of the Worlds (1898): Science Fiction,Science Fiction,"The narrative opens by stating that as humans on Earth busied themselves with their own endeavours during the 1890s aliens on Mars began plotting an invasion of Earth to replenish their limited resources. In 1899 the narrator is invited to an astronomical observatory at Ottershaw where explosions are seen on the surface of the planet Mars creating much interest in the scientific community. Later a ""meteor"" lands on Horsell Common near the unnamed narrator's home in Woking Surrey. He is among the first to discover that the object is an artificial cylinder that opens disgorging Martians who are ""big"" and ""greyish"" with ""oily brown skin"" ""the size perhaps of a bear"" each with ""two large dark-coloured eyes"" and lipless ""V-shaped mouths"" which drip saliva and are surrounded by two ""Gorgon groups of tentacles."" The narrator finds them ""at once vital intense inhuman crippled and monstrous.""[7] They briefly emerge have difficulty in coping with the Earth's atmosphere and gravity and rapidly retreat into their cylinder. A human deputation (which includes the astronomer Ogilvy) approaches the cylinder with a white flag but the Martians incinerate them and others nearby with a heat-ray before beginning to assemble their machinery. Military forces arrive that night to surround the common including Maxim guns. The population of Woking and the surrounding villages are reassured by the presence of the British Army. A tense day begins with much anticipation of military action by the narrator.After heavy firing from the common and damage to the town from the heat-ray which suddenly erupts in the late afternoon the narrator takes his wife to safety in nearby Leatherhead where his cousin lives using a rented two-wheeled horse cart; he then returns to Woking to return the cart when in the early morning hours a violent thunderstorm erupts. On the road during the height of the storm he has his first terrifying sight of a fast-moving Martian fighting-machine; in a panic he crashes the horse cart barely escaping detection. He discovers the Martians have assembled towering three-legged ""fighting-machines"" (tripods) each armed with a heat-ray and a chemical weapon: the poisonous ""black smoke."" These tripods have wiped out the army units positioned around the cylinder and attacked and destroyed most of Woking. Sheltering in his house the narrator sees a fleeing artilleryman moving through his garden who later tells the narrator of his experiences and mentions that another cylinder has landed between Woking and Leatherhead cutting off the narrator from his wife. The two try to escape via Byfleet just after dawn but are separated at the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry during a Martian afternoon attack on Shepperton. One of the Martian fighting-machines is brought down in the River Thames by artillery as the narrator and countless others try to cross the river into Middlesex as the Martians retreat back to their original crater. This gives the authorities precious hours to form a defence-line covering London. After the Martians' temporary repulse the narrator is able to float down the Thames in a boat toward London stopping at Walton where he first encounters the curate his companion for the coming weeks.... Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946) usually referred to as H. G. Wells was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres writing dozens of novels short stories and works of social commentary satire biography and autobiography including even two books on war games."

The Golden Age of Science Fiction,Science Fiction,A detailed look at the British world of science fiction in the 1950s. John Wade grew up in the 1950s a decade that has since been dubbed the “golden age of science fiction.” It was a wonderful decade for the genre but not so great for young fans. With early television broadcasts being advertised for the first time as “unsuitable for children” and the inescapable barrier of the “X” certificate in the cinema barring anyone under the age of sixteen the author had only the radio to fall back on—and that turned out to be more fertile for the budding SF fan than might otherwise have been thought. Which is probably why as he grew older rediscovering those old TV broadcasts and films that had been out of bounds when he was a kid took on a lure that soon became an obsession. For him the super-accuracy and amazing technical quality of today’s science fiction films pale into insignificance beside the radio early TV and B-picture films about people who built rockets in their back gardens and flew them to lost planets or tales of aliens who wanted to take over if not our entire world then at least our bodies. This book is a personal account of John Wade’s fascination with the genre across all the entertainment media in which it appeared—the sort of stuff he reveled in as a young boy—and still enjoys today. “Not only a well–researched book grounded in hundreds of sources but also an unmistakable labor of love.” —New York Journal of Books

Only a few know the terrifying truth—an outcast Earth scientist a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.

Psience Fiction,Science Fiction,"Science fiction has often been considered the literature of futuristic technology: fantastic warfare among the stars or ruinous apocalypses on Earth. The last century however saw through John W. Campbell the introduction of ""psience fiction"" which explores such themes of mental powers as telepathy precognition of the future teleportation etc.--and symbolic machines that react to such forces. The author surveys this long-ignored literary shift through a series of influential novels and short stories published between the 1930s and the present. This discussion is framed by the sudden surge of interest in parapsychology and its absorption not only into the SF genre but also into the real world through military experiments such as the Star Gate Program."

Young Adult Science Fiction,Science Fiction,At the close of the nineteenth century American youths developed a growing interest in electricity and its applications machines and gadgetry. When authors and publishers recognized the extent of this interest in technology they sought to create reading materials that would meet this market need. The result was science fiction written especially for young adults. While critics tended to neglect young adult science fiction for decades they gradually came to recognize its practical and cultural value. Science fiction inspired many young adults to study science and engineering and helped foster technological innovation. At the same time these works also explored cultural and social concerns more commonly associated with serious literature. Nor was young adult science fiction a peculiarly American phenomenon: authors in other countries likewise wrote science fiction for young adult readers. This book examines young adult science fiction in the U.S. and several other countries and explores issues central to the genre. The first part of the book treats the larger contexts of young adult science fiction and includes chapters on its history and development. Included are discussions of science fiction for young adults in the U.S. and in Canada Great Britain Germany and Australia. These chapters are written by expert contributors and chart the history of young adult science fiction from the nineteenth century to the present. The second section of the book considers topics of special interest to young adult science fiction. Some of the chapters look at particular forms and expressions of science fiction such as films and comic books. Others treat particular topics such as the portrayal of women in Robert Heinlein's works and representations of war in young adult science fiction. Yet another chapter studies the young adult science fiction novel as a coming-of-age story and thus helps distinguish the genre from science fiction written for adult readers. All chapters reflect current research and the volume concludes with extensive bibliographies.

Futurescapes,Science Fiction,This book testifies to the growing interest in the many spaces of utopia. It intends to 'map out' on utopian and science-fiction discourses some of the new and revisionist models of spatial analysis applied in Literary and Cultural Studies in recent years. The aim of the volume is to side-step the established generic binary of utopia and dystopia or science fiction and thus to open the analysis of utopian literature to new lines of inquiry. The essays collected here propose to think of utopias not so much as fictional texts about future change and transformation but as vital elements in a cultural process through which social spatial and subjective identities are formed. Utopias can thus be read as textual systems implying a distinct spatial and temporal dimension; as 'spatial practices' that tend to naturalize a cultural and social construction - that of the 'good life' the radically improved welfare state the Christian paradise the counter-society etc. - and make that representation operational by interpellating their readers in some determinate relation to their givenness as sites of political and individual improvement. This volume is of interest for all scholars and students of literature who wish to explore the ways in which utopias of the past and recent present have circulated as media of cultural exchange and homogenization as sites of cultural and linguistic appropriation and as foci for the spatial formation of national and regional identities in the English-speaking world.

Science Fiction Children's Literature and Popular Culture,Science Fiction,Literature often is central to individual maturation. It typically reflects in one way or another the experiences of the reader and the larger strains of society. This book examines representative works of science fiction children's literature and popular culture as mirrors of what it means to grow up in the late 20th century world. That world is permeated by technology and technology thus figures prominently in the process of growing up and in these literary works.

A Distant Technology,Science Fiction,"Science fiction films celebrate and critique the impact of a burgeoning technology on the world's cultural political and social milieu. The Machine Age roughly delineated by the two decades between World Wars was a watershed period during which modern society entered into an ambiguous embrace with technology that continues today. J. P. Telotte carefully blends film technology cultural and genre studies to illuminate this nearly forgotten era in our cinematic history and to show through analysis of classics like The Invisible Ray Metropolis and Things to Come how technology played a major role as motif ""actor"" and producer. What he also discovers as he ranges among the American British Russian French and German science fiction cinema — as well as mainstream films figures and cultural products such as the New York World's Fair — is a fundamental ambivalence embedded in the films themselves about the very machine-age ethos they promoted. Even as advances in the technical apparatus of filmmaking elevated it from mere entertainment to a medium of general communication and genuine artistic expression Machine Age science fiction films remained curiously distant from and often skeptical of the very machines on which their narratives focus. The resulting tensions Telotte writes ""thus seem to intersect with those implicit in a Western world that was struggling with its own transition into the modern"" rendering the films' task inevitably paradoxical and difficult"
Extreme Fabulations,Science Fiction,An examination of science fiction narratives and the light they shed on human life the unknowable future and the vagaries of unforeseeable change. With this book Steven Shaviro offers a thought experiment. He discusses a number of science fiction narratives: three novels one novella three short stories and one musical concept album. Shaviro not only analyzes these works in detail but also uses them to ask questions about human and more generally biological life: about its stubborn insistence and yet fragility; about the possibilities and perils of seeking to control it; about the aesthetic and social dimensions of human existence in relation to the nonhuman; and about the ethical value of human life under conditions of extreme oppression and devastation. Shaviro pursues these questions through the medium of science fiction because this form of storytelling offers us a unique way of grappling with issues that deeply and unavoidably concern us but that are intractable to rational argumentation or to empirical verification. The future is unavoidably vague and multifarious; it stubbornly resists our efforts to know it in advance let alone to guide it or circumscribe it. But science fiction takes up this very vagueness and indeterminacy and renders it into the form of a self-consciously fictional narrative. It gives us characters who experience and respond to the vagaries of unforeseeable change.
Against the Night the Stars,Science Fiction,Analyzes Clarke's stories and novels discusses his major themes and looks at how Clarke uses character plot and scientific concepts.
Simultaneous Worlds,Science Fiction,Since the 1927 release of Fritz Lang’s pioneer film Metropolis science fiction cinema has largely been regarded a Western genre. In Simultaneous Worlds Jennifer L. Feeley and Sarah Ann Wells showcase authors who challenge this notion by focusing on cinemas and cultures from Cuba to North Korea not traditionally associated with science fiction. This collection introduces films about a metal-eating monster who helps peasants overthrow an exploitative court an inflatable sex doll who comes to life a desert planet where matchsticks are more valuable than money and more. Simultaneous Worlds is the first volume to bring a transnational interdisciplinary lens to science fiction cinema. Encountering some of the best emerging and established voices in the field readers will become immersed in discussions of well-known works such as the Ghost in the Shell franchise and Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 alongside lesser-known but equally fascinating works by African Asian European and South American filmmakers. Divided into five parts that cover theoretical concerns such as new media economies translation the Global South cyborgs and socialist and postsocialist cinema these essays trace cinema’s role in imagining global communities and power struggles. Considering both individual films and the broader networks of production distribution and exhibition Simultaneous Worlds illustrates how film industries across the globe take part in visualizing the perils of globalization and technological modernity. Ultimately this book opens new ways of thinking about world cinema and our understanding of the world at large.

The Science Fiction Dimensions of Salman Rushdie,Science Fiction,"This book focuses on the science fictional dimensions of Rushdie's later novels Fury The Ground Beneath Her Feet Shalimar the Clown and Luka and the Fire of Life and Rushdie's first unpublished novel The Antagonist to show how the author's oeuvre moves towards a more consistent engagement with science fiction as a generic form and an ideological investment. The author demonstrates how Rushdie recreates personal and national histories in a science fictional setting and mode and contends that the failure of his first novel Grimus may have led Rushdie away from SF for some time although he returns to it with a much firmer conviction and a much stronger voice in his later novels showing his commitment to this imaginative form which he describes in Fury as providing ""the best popular vehicle ever devised for the novel of ideas and metaphysics.""The science fictional mode is the most appropriate vehicle for expressing these thematic and ideological concerns and the organizing feature of Rushdie's oeuvre. The author rereads the later novels in light of recent critical engagement with SF as a vehicle for reimagining national histories and as a potentially subversive tool for social and political engagement in a fictional realm."
Homo Cosmicus,Science Fiction,In 1989 the Brazilian student Paulo Roberto was abducted by a “flying saucer”. His captors are representatives of a super developed civilization inhabiting the star Cygni 61 which they call Omeron. This is civilization-parent of the terrestrial one. For an earth man such as Paulo this is a strange and completely unaccustomed world in every respect. On this planet money and states do not exist. They have withered away; the same way as verbal speech has withered away too replaced by telepathy. In this civilization things are accomplished by the direct exchange of energy – without money as well as the direct exchange of information – without speech; all are united in a common energy-info exchange. These humans look somehow not so solid not so heavy pale and faintly gauzy. They are an odd society of slightly lucent at times yogis. They have a transparent blood and unknown metabolism. But even the bravest visionary’s dreams cannot vie with this reality – for these humans can fly! Yes! These nondescript supermen almost imperishable and ethereal soar through the air like biblical angels. In 2023 Paulo comes back to the Earth. What does he find here and what happens with him then?

The Fortean Influence on Science Fiction,Science Fiction,Charles Fort was an American researcher from the early twentieth century who cataloged reports of unexplained phenomena he found in newspapers and science journals. A minor bestseller with a cult appeal Fort's work was posthumously republished in the pulp science fiction magazine Astounding Stories in 1934. His idiosyncratic books fascinated scared and entertained readers many of them authors and editors of science fiction. Fort's work prophesied the paranormal mainstays of SF literature to come: UFOs poltergeists strange disappearances cryptids ancient mysteries unexplained natural phenomena and everything in between. Science fiction authors latched on to Fort's topics and hypotheses as perfect fodder for SF stories. Writers like Arthur C. Clarke Philip K. Dick Robert Heinlein H.P. Lovecraft and others are examined in this exploration of Fortean science fiction--a genre that borrows from the reports and ideas of Fort and others who saw the possible science-fictional nature of our reality.

Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction,Science Fiction,Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction examines the fascination with suicidal crises evident in a range of science fiction. Specifically this study explores a seemingly counterintuitive proposition: in moments of dramatic scientific and technological change the authors of these works frequently cast self-destructive episodes as catalysts for beneficial change. Carlos Gutierrez-Jones argues that this creative self-destruction mechanism is invoked by H. G. Wells as a means of negotiating Victorian anxieties regarding evolutionary theory by Stanislaw Lem as he wrestles with the prospect of nuclear self-destruction at the dawn of the space age by William Gibson as he considers the development of artificial intelligence by Christopher Nolan as he explores the cybernetic colonization of the unconscious by Rian Johnson as he links aspects of video gaming to the neoliberal militarization of institutions and by Margaret Atwood as she considers impending ecological disaster and the rise of bioterrorism. These authors often depict such scientific and technological changes in a fashion that requires the central characters to transform themselves in hopes of remaining relevant in a radically altered environment.
Science Fiction Cinema,Science Fiction,This major new study offers a broad historical and theoretical reassessment of the science fiction film genre.

Films discussed include The Day the Earth Stood Still The Body Snatchers Forbidden Planet The Quatermass Experiment 2001: A Space Odyssey Demon Seed Star Trek: The Motion Picture Star Wars Altered States Alien Blade Runner The Brother from Another Planet Back to the Future The Terminator Predator The One Dark City The Matrix Fifth Elementand eXistenZ.

Once and Future Antiquities in Science Fiction and Fantasy,Science Fiction,In 15 all-new essays this volume explores how science fiction and fantasy draw on materials from ancient Greece and Rome 'displacing' them from their original settings-in time and space in points of origins and genre-and encouraging readers to consider similar 'displacements' in the modern world. Modern examples from a wide range of media and genres-including Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and the novels of Helen Oyeyemi the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and the role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K-are brought alongside episodes from ancient myth important moments from history and more. All together these multifaceted studies add to our understanding of how science fiction and fantasy form important areas of classical reception not only transmitting but also transmuting images of antiquity. The volume concludes with an inspiring personal reflection from the New York Times-bestselling author of speculative fiction Catherynne M. Valente offering her perspective on the limitless potential of the classical world to resonate with experience today.

The Time Machine Hypothesis,Science Fiction,Every age has characteristic inventions that change the world. In the 19th century it was the steam engine and the train. For the 20th electric and gasoline power aircraft nuclear weapons even ventures into space. Today the planet is awash with electronic business chatter and virtual-reality entertainment so brilliant that the division between real and simulated is hard to discern. But one new idea from the 19th century has failed so far to enter reality—time travel using machines to turn the time dimension into a two-way highway. Will it come true as foreseen in science fiction? Might we expect visits to and from the future sooner than from space? That is the Time Machine Hypothesis examined here by futurist Damien Broderick an award-winning writer and theorist of the genre of the future.

With a pair of bespoke-made sapphire and diamond earrings on board and a trip across the city in the offing what could possibly go wrong? Everything.

Suitable for any reader of any age from 10 up - younger readers who have read all the Harry Potter books without any worries will be fine with the Hamgeean Misfit stories. Close Enough is the third book in the Hamgeen Misfit dystopian humorous science fiction series. It is set in a contemporary dystopia in a parallel reality but there is some futuristic technology. There is an overall story arc but these funny comedy stories are written to be stand alone and can be read in any order. **** INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR Q – What made you write this series? A – If you want the honest answer I wrote it for me. As a reader I love British satire and humor (or humour). I love wit; funny epic fantasy series like the Discworld novels and comedic sci fi like Douglas Adams. I like sff and speculative fiction I like adventure and action and a gripping tale that zips along quickly I like genre mash ups and I love an angsty dystopian world but the best science fiction and fantasy stories for me are funny. I am to write comedy in the tradition of all the great humorous British authors. I like to aim high. I wanted protagonists people could love and empathise with mavericks misfit characters real people ... except they're not all people obviously some of them are other alien (ish) species. This book is about misfit heroes and heroines winning the day it’s about good versus evil even when the good guys are on different sides. It's dystopian science fiction fantasy action - it's dystopia but it's comedy it's sci-fi but it's planet-based. You'll find all sorts of quirky characters and interesting alien species: from 6ft Swamp Things with antennae to cute furry creatures like the Blurpons with their fluffy ears big button eyes and penchant for extreme violence. Oh and there's this debrief scene ... *** SIMILAR AUTHORS: Robert Rankin C Gockel Patty Jansen JJ Greene FJ Savage Heide Goodey EM Foner Robert Asprin the Stainless Steel Rat and Space Team series.

The Stars My Destination,Science Fiction,"﻿#5 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series a library of the finest science fiction ever written. “Science fiction has only produced a few works of actual genius and this is one of them.” —Joe Haldeman #5 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series a library of the finest science fiction ever written. “Science fiction has only produced a few works of actual genius and this is one of them.” —Joe Haldeman ""Bester at the peak of his powers is quite simply unbeatable” —James Lovegrove Marooned in outer space after an attack on his ship Nomad Gulliver Foyle lives to obsessively pursue the crew of a rescue vessel that had intended to leave him to die. When it comes to pop culture Alfred Bester (1913-1987) is something of an unsung hero. He wrote radio scripts screenplays and comic books (in which capacity he created the original Green Lantern Oath). But Bester is best known for his science-fiction novels and The Stars My Destination may be his finest creation. With its sly potshotting at corporate skullduggery The Stars My Destination seems utterly contemporary and has maintained its status as an underground classic for fifty years. (Bester fans should also note that iBooks has reprinted ReDemolished which won the very first Hugo Award in 1953.)"

Wizards Aliens and Starships,Science Fiction,Explaining the science behind science fiction and fantasy—from the probable to the impossible From teleportation and space elevators to alien contact and interstellar travel science fiction and fantasy writers have come up with some brilliant and innovative ideas. Yet how plausible are these ideas--for instance could Mr. Weasley's flying car in the Harry Potter books really exist? Which concepts might actually happen and which ones wouldn’t work at all? Wizards Aliens and Starships delves into the most extraordinary details in science fiction and fantasy--such as time warps shape changing rocket launches and illumination by floating candle--and shows readers the physics and math behind the phenomena. With simple mathematical models and in most cases using no more than high school algebra Charles Adler ranges across a plethora of remarkable imaginings from the works of Ursula K. Le Guin to Star Trek and Avatar to explore what might become reality. Adler explains why fantasy in the Harry Potter and Dresden Files novels cannot adhere strictly to scientific laws and when magic might make scientific sense in the muggle world. He examines space travel and wonders why it isn’t cheaper and more common today. Adler also discusses exoplanets and how the search for alien life has shifted from radio communications to space-based telescopes. He concludes by investigating the future survival of humanity and other intelligent races. Throughout he cites an abundance of science fiction and fantasy authors and includes concise descriptions of stories as well as an appendix on Newton's laws of motion. Wizards Aliens and Starships will speak to anyone wanting to know about the correct--and incorrect--science of science fiction and fantasy.

Worlds and selves falling apart - The science fiction of Philip K. Dick,Science Fiction,Swiss Diploma Thesis from the year 2000 in the subject American Studies - Literature grade: 1.5 (A) University of Zurich (English Seminar) language: English abstract: Philip K. Dick's science fiction can be seen as a discussion of the human condition in a world where nothing is what it seems. Human identity has become uncertain as has the nature of reality itself. This Dickian ontology has a striking similarity to postmodernist theories by thinkers such as Jameson Baudrillard and McHale most of whom by the way have a weak spot for science fiction. The discussion of Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories against a backdrop of postmodernist theory leads to conclusions that are not only relevant for the author's particular poetics but for the ontology of our lives in times that science fiction couldn't have imagined. This work focusses on Philip K. Dick's unstable worlds and subjects investigating Dickian space time and meaning as well as the author's subjects and the question of schizophrenia and paranoia. Works discussed include Ubik Time Out of Joint The Man in the High Castle A Maze of Death Eye in the Sky A Scanner Darkly Martian Time-Slip and Impostor.

Vacation Stories,Science Fiction,A world-famous neurobiologist Santiago Ramn y Cajal won the Nobel Prize for his scientific research in 1906. The previous year he published these stories: five ingenious tales that take a microscopic look at the nature allure and danger of scientific curiosity. Ramn y Cajal waited almost twenty years to publish these stories because he feared they would compromise his scientific career. Featuring the cutting-edge science of the mid-1880s (microscopy bacteriology and hypnosis) they probe the seductive power that proceeds from scientific knowledge and explore how the pursuit of such knowledge alternately redeems and ensnares humanity. Here revenge is disguised as research and common fraud as moral purification. Critical thought vies with moribund tradition and stifling religion for a hold on the human spirit; rigid divisions of class and wealth dissolve before the indiscriminate assault of microbes. One man's faith in science gives him the tools to outwit superstition and win the true love and happiness for which he has sacrificed. that melds the epiphany of A Christmas Carol with the macabre detail of an Edgar Allan Poe story.Now available for the first time in English Ramn y Cajal's stories reveal a great deal about human nature and the collusion of ambition and greed that prey on the hapless and thoughtless whether in the name of science religion or the state. Laura Otis whose dual background in literature and science echoes that of the author has crafted a sparkling translation that captures the wit and imagination of the original.

Alien Constructions,Science Fiction,“An incisive critical work” that looks at Octavia Butler’s writing the movies of the Matrix and Alien series—and more—through a feminist lens (Femspec). Feminist thinkers and writers are increasingly recognizing science fiction’s potential to shatter patriarchal and heterosexual norms while the creators of science fiction are bringing new depth and complexity to the genre by engaging with feminist thewories and politics. This book maps the intersection of feminism and science fiction through close readings of science fiction literature by Octavia E. Butler Richard Calder and Melissa Scott and the movies The Matrix and the Alien series. Patricia Melzer analyzes how these authors and films represent debates and concepts in three areas of feminist thought: identity and difference feminist critiques of science and technology and the relationship among gender identity body and desire including the new gender politics of queer desires transgender and intersexed bodies and identities. She demonstrates that key political elements shape these debates including global capitalism and exploitative class relations within a growing international system; the impact of computer industrial and medical technologies on women’s lives and reproductive rights; and posthuman embodiment as expressed through biotechnologies the body/machine interface and the commodification of desire. Melzer’s investigation makes it clear that feminist writings and readings of science fiction are part of a feminist critique of existing power relations—and that the alien constructions (cyborgs clones androids aliens and hybrids) that populate postmodern science fiction are as potentially empowering as they are threatening.

Each individual lives in isolation in a 'cell' with all bodily and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent global Machine.

People forget that humans created the Machine and treat it as a mystical entity whose needs supersede their own. Those who do not accept the deity of the Machine are viewed as 'unmechanical' and are threatened with ""Homelessness"". Eventually the Machine apocalyptically collapses and the civilization of the Machine comes to an end."

Equipping Space Cadets,Science Fiction,Equipping Space Cadets: Primary Science Fiction for Young Children argues for the benefits and potential of “primary science fiction” or science fiction for children under twelve years old. Science fiction for children is often disregarded due to common misconceptions of childhood. When children are culturally portrayed as natural and simple they seem like a poor audience for the complex scientific questions brought up by the best science fiction. The books and the children who read them tell another story. Using three empirical studies and over 350 children’s books including If I Had a Robot Dog Bugs in Space and Commander Toad in Space Equipping Space Cadets presents interdisciplinary evidence that science fiction and children are compatible after all. Primary science fiction literature includes many high-quality books that cleverly utilize the features of children’s literature formats in order to fit large science fiction questions into small packages. In the best of these books authors make science fiction questions accessible and relevant to children of various reading levels and from diverse backgrounds and identities. Equipping Space Cadets does not stop with literary analysis but also presents the voices of real children and practitioners. The book features three studies: a survey of teachers and librarians quantitative analysis of lending records from school libraries across the United States and coded read-aloud sessions with elementary school students. The results reveal how children are interested in and capable of reading science fiction but it is the adults including the most well-intentioned librarians and teachers who hinder children's engagement with the genre due to their own preconceptions about the genre and children.

He was born in a hopeless future and is doomed to travel in the past and repair humanity's problems before they can happen. Unfortunately every time he returns to the abyss outside of time he loses all memory of what just occurred. The only information Johnson has of his existence is a one-page letter written to himself reminding him of his duties. Over and over he must follow his nightmares and repair the damage done by those in the past. Time is in a perpetual state of turmoil for Johnson but he lives in a future free of damage. His duty is to erase all possibility of the predicted Crisis!
Gendering Science Fiction Films,Science Fiction,In the 1950s science fiction invasion films played a complicated part in supporting and criticizing Cold War ideologies.

Economic Science Fictions,Science Fiction,An innovative new anthology exploring how science fiction can motivate new approaches to economics. From the libertarian economics of Ayn Rand to Aldous Huxley's consumerist dystopias economics and science fiction have often orbited each other. In Economic Science Fictions editor William Davies has deliberately merged the two worlds asking how we might harness the power of the utopian imagination to revitalize economic thinking. Rooted in the sense that our current economic reality is no longer credible or viable this collection treats our economy as a series of fictions and science fiction as a means of anticipating different economic futures. It asks how science fiction can motivate new approaches to economics and provides surprising new syntheses merging social science with fiction design with politics scholarship with experimental forms. With an opening chapter from Ha-Joon Chang as well as theory short stories and reflections on design this book from Goldsmiths Press challenges and changes the notion that economics and science fiction are worlds apart. The result is a wealth of fresh and unusual perspectives for anyone who believes the economy is too important to be left solely to economists.

American Silent Horror Science Fiction and Fantasy Feature Films 1913-1929,Science Fiction,"During the Silent Era when most films dealt with dramatic or comedic takes on the ""boy meets girl boy loses girl"" theme other motion pictures dared to tackle such topics as rejuvenation revivication mesmerism the supernatural and the grotesque.

Imagining Urban Futures,Science Fiction,What science fiction can teach us about urban planning Carl Abbott who has taught urban studies and urban planning in five decades brings together urban studies and literary studies to examine how fictional cities in work by authors as different as E. M. Forster Isaac Asimov Kim Stanley Robinson and China Miéville might help us to envision an urban future that is viable and resilient. Imagining Urban Futures is a remarkable treatise on what is best and strongest in urban theory and practice today as refracted and intensely imagined in science fiction. As the human population grows we can envision an increasingly urban society. Shifting weather patterns rising sea levels reduced access to resources and a host of other issues will radically impact urban environments while technology holds out the dream of cities beyond Earth. Abbott delivers a compelling critical discussion of science fiction cities found in literary works television programs and films of many eras from Metropolis to Blade Runner and Soylent Green to The Hunger Games among many others.

Germany,Science Fiction,In I THINK I AM: PHILIP K. DICK Laurence A. Rickels investigated the renowned science fiction author's collected work by way of its relationship to the concept and condition of schizophrenia. In GERMANY: A SCIENCE FICTION he focuses on psychopathy as the undeclared diagnosis implied in flunking the empathy test. The switch from psychosis to psychopathy as an organizing limit opens the prospect of a genealogy of the Cold War era which Rickels begins by examining Dick's THE SIMULACRA and follows out with readings of SIMULACRON 3 FAHRENHEIT 451 THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS THIS ISLAND EARTH and GRAVITY'S RAINBOW among many other genealogical stations. Nazi Germany hosted the first season of the realization of science fantasy with the rocket at the top of this arc. After World War II the genre had to delete the recent past and start again within the new Cold War opposition. Certainly the ancestral prehistory was still intact (in the works of for instance Jules Verne and H. G. Wells). At the bulk rate of its generic line of production however science fiction would thereafter become a native to the Cold War habitat. This study addresses the syndications of the missing era in the science fiction mainstream the phantasmagoria of its returns and the extent of the integration of all the above since some point in the 1980s. Rickels works through the preliminaries of repair that must be met in a world devastated by psychopathic violence before mourning can even be a need. While I THINK I AM was the endopsychic allegory of Dick's corpus GERMANY takes the corpus as a point of context for the endopsychic genealogy of the post-WWII containment and integration of psychopathy.

Science Fiction and Climate Change,Science Fiction,Shortlisted for the British Science Fiction Association Best Non-Fiction Award 2020 Shortlisted for the Locus Science Fiction Foundation Non-Fiction Award 2021 Despite the occasional upsurge of climate change scepticism amongst Anglophone conservative politicians and journalists there is still a near-consensus amongst climate scientists that current levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas are sufficient to alter global weather patterns to disastrous effect. The resultant climate crisis is simultaneously both a natural and a socio-cultural phenomenon and in this book Milner and Burgmann argue that science fiction occupies a critical location within this nature/culture nexus. Science Fiction and Climate Change takes as its subject matter what Daniel Bloom famously dubbed 'cli-fi'. It does not however attempt to impose a prescriptively environmentalist aesthetic on this sub-genre. Rather it seeks to explain how a genre defined in relation to science finds itself obliged to produce fictional responses to the problems actually thrown up by contemporary scientific research. Milner and Burgmann adopt a historically and geographically comparatist framework analysing print and audio-visual texts drawn from a number of different contexts especially Australia Britain Canada China Finland France Germany Japan and the United States. Inspired by Williams's cultural materialism Bourdieu's sociology of culture and Moretti's version of world systems theory the book builds on Milner's own Locating Science Fiction to produce a powerfully persuasive study in the sociology of literature.

The Mystery and the World,Mystery,"During the past century an enormous effervescence of events changed the sociopolitical configuration of the world. The interpretation of these facts helped further deepen the crisis in which modern thought already found itself--and it generated the uncertain and unstable environment in which we live today the so-called postmodernity late modernity or hypermodernity. In this context one of the most profound impacts is most certainly the one on religion. During the twentieth century religion proved not to be banished from the human horizon as the masters of suspicion intended. Known as the godless century the twentieth century saw also a resuscitation of the search for the sense of life and spirituality. With the crisis of modern reason humankind turned toward consumerism and provisional and ""light"" practices. The last century represents not only the height of the postmodernization process but also the rescue of the transcendent and absolute even if it is an absolute without face and identity. It is in this scenario that religious experiences apparently exiled by modern rationality begin to occur and multiply again. Mystical experiences will be then the basis for highlighting recurrent characteristics with universal import. But they will show a different configuration than before. One will be able to find them not in so-called sacred spaces but in very secular ones; not so much within institutions but at the borders or even outside them; not configured by a specific tradition but in an interface that makes more than one tradition meet and dialogue."

"The ""Mystery of History"" its Functionalisation and Disintegration in Graham Swift’s ""Waterland""",Mystery,Seminar paper from the year 2021 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature grade: 10  language: English abstract: This paper investigates how the ambivalent perhaps even ambiguous definition of ‘historia’ relates to the representation of history in the novel and how this representation again relates to its functionalisation by Tom Crick. To answer this question this paper will primarily work with Linda Hutcheon’s notion of ‘historiographic metafiction’ while also pointing out similarities to the reading of Waterland as a trauma narrative. In taking a closer look at the protagonist-narrator himself this paper argues that the protection “from chaos and disorder” which Landow addresses is only achieved through a form of historical escapism. Superficially speaking Graham Swift’s Waterland is a novel about a history teacher who having lost his job forsakes the formal teaching of history and embarks on an extracurricular journey into his own past. However upon closer examination Waterland is more than that a novel about history itself. It explores “the whole mystery of ‘history’” as Swift himself puts it in the introduction to the novel (Waterland xv). Thus it is only logical that the novel prefaces its narrative with an insightful epigraph: a dictionary definition of the Latin word ‘historia’ from which the English word ‘history’ originates. As can be seen above however said definition is ambivalent- it is “inherently polysemantic” as Judith Ryan notes. James Acheson has likewise pointed out that the fact that “historia can mean either history or fiction is significant for the historian and the writer of fiction must deal with similar problems in writing about the past”. The natural tendency of language towards proliferation of its meaning aside the epigraph leaves us with a very ambivalent concept of history which the narrative of Waterland in its dealing with history then builds on. Since such a prominent theme in Waterland the novel’s representation of history has been thoroughly examined in secondary literature; particularly against the theoretical background of what Linda Hutcheon has identified as ‘historiographic metafiction’.

Reading The Monogram Murders was like returning to a favorite room of a long-lost home.” — Gillian Flynn author of Gone Girl Hercule Poirot returns home after an agreeable luncheon to find an angry woman waiting to berate him outside his front door. Her name is Sylvia Rule and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence however and she marches away in a rage. Shaken Poirot goes inside only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him — a man called John McCrodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy... Poirot wonders how many more letters of this sort have been sent in his name. Who sent them and why? More importantly who is Barnabas Pandy is he dead and if so was he murdered? And can Poirot find out the answers without putting more lives in danger?

THE RED THUMB MARK THE EYE OF OSIRIS & THE MYSTERY OF 31 NEW INN (3 British Mystery Classics in One Volume),Mystery,"This carefully crafted ebook: ""THE RED THUMB MARK THE EYE OF OSIRIS & THE MYSTERY OF 31 NEW INN (3 British Mystery Classics in One Volume)"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Dr. John Thorndyke is a fictional detective in a series of novels. He is a medical jurispractitioner - originally a medical doctor he turned to the bar and became one of the first in modern parlance forensic scientists. His solutions were based on his method of collecting all possible data (including dust and pond weed) and making inferences from them before looking at any of the protagonists and motives in the crimes. It is this method which gave rise to one of Freeman's most ingenious inventions the inverted detective story where the criminal act is described first and the interest lies in Thorndyke's subsequent unraveling of it. Richard Austin Freeman (1862-1943) was a British writer of detective stories mostly featuring the medico-legal forensic investigator Dr. Thorndyke. Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial surgeon in his novels. Many of the Dr. Thorndyke stories involve genuine but often quite arcane points of scientific knowledge from areas such as tropical medicine metallurgy and toxicology.

The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,Mystery,"""The Mystery of a Hansom Cab"" takes place in Melbourne Australia and involves an investigation into a homicide after a corpse is discovered in the evening in a hansom cab. The city of Melbourne plays a significant role in the plot and as the author describes: ""Over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall."" The killer's identity is not as significant a revelation in the story as are the roles of the influential and secretive Frettlby family and their secret: they have an illegitimate daughter living on the streets. The class divide between Melbourne's wealthy and less fortunate is addressed throughout the plot. The protagonist in the novel is a policeman named Detective Gorby who is given the task of solving the murder. As Hume describes the character's investigative skills: ""He looked keenly round the room and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once."" The author commented in a later introduction ""All of the scenes in the book especially the slums are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street gathering material."" At this time the street had gained notoriety as a place frequented by prostitutes and criminals."

Most of them use low-quality papers & binding. Their pages fall off easily. Some of them even use very small font size of 6 or less to increase their profit margin. It makes their books completely unreadable. How is this book unique? Unabridged (100% Original content) Font adjustments & biography included Illustrated The Mystery of the Sea by Bram Stoker The Mystery of the Sea a novel by Bram Stoker was originally published in 1902. Stoker is best known for his 1897 novel Dracula but The Mystery of the Sea contains many of the same compelling elements. It tells the story of an Englishman living in Aberdeenshire Scotland who meets and falls in love with an American heiress. She is involved with the intrigues of the Spanish-American War and a complex plot involving Second Sight kidnapping and secret codes unfolds over the course of the novel. The Mystery of the Sea contains supernatural elements but is in many respects a political thriller. Stoker draws from personal experience and incorporates historical strands from the Spanish-American War as well as the sixteenth-century conflict between Spain and Elizabethan England using these events to explore important themes of his time such as national identity and changing concepts of womanhood. Although The Mystery of the Sea received many favorable reviews when it was published (and many of the criticisms it received could be equally well applied to Dracula) it has been significantly overshadowed in scholarship and criticism by Dracula. Plot: Archibald Hunter a young Englishman is passing his leisure time near Cruden Bay in the small Scottish village of Whinnyfold when he has a vision of a couple walking past him carrying a tiny coffin. Archibald also notices a strange old woman watching him. Later he finds out that his vision has come true and a child in town has died. Archibald encounters the bizarre old woman again on the seashore; this woman who introduces herself as Gormala MacNeil knows that Archibald saw something out of the ordinary. She proceeds to explain that she has ""Second Sight""-a sort of psychic ability for premonition that comes and goes at random-and that she can tell that Archibald too is a Seer. Fluctuating between skepticism and uneasiness over his newfound abilities Archibald listens to Gormala's insights and sees one of his visions fulfilled at Lammas-tide when he and Gormala witness Lauchlane Macleod a local fisherman wreck his boat on a chain of sharp rocks known as the Skares. Archibald sees a procession of dead spirits emerge from the water near the Skares and make its way up the cliffs. About a year later Archibald has returned to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get back to shore and learns that one of the ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack and the other a young beautiful woman named Marjory an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher). Archibald soon proposes marriage to Marjory but she declines with the excuse that she does not know him well enough."

The Agony Column (the Second Floor Mystery),Mystery,"This early work by Earl Derr Biggers was originally published in 1916 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. The Agony Column (also published as Second Floor Mystery) is a romantic suspense thriller narrated in a series of seven letters between two prospective lovers. Earl Derr Biggers was born on 26th August 1884 in Warren Ohio USA. Biggers received his further education at Harvard University where he developed a reputation as a literary rebel preferring the popular modern authors such as Rudyard Kipling and Richard Harding Davis to the established figures of classical literature. While on holiday in Hawaii Biggers heard tales of a real-life Chinese detective operating in Honolulu named Chang Apana. This inspired him to create his most enduring legacy in the character of super-sleuth Charlie Chan. The first Chan story ""The House Without a Key"" (1925) was published as a serialised story in the Saturday Evening Post and then released as a novel in the same year. Biggers went on to write five more Chan novels and all were licensed for movie adaptations by Fox Films. These films were hugely popular with several different actors taking the lead role of Chan. They were even a success in China where the appeal of a character from the country being the hero instead of the villain appealed to film-goers. Eventually; over 40 films were produced featuring the character. Biggers only saw the early on-screen successes of Charlie Chan due to his death at the age of only 48 from a heart attack in April 1933."

Subversive Seduction,Romance,"Male-male rivalry and female passive choice the two principal tenets of Darwinian sexual selection raise important ethical questions in The Descent of Man--and in the decades since--about the subjugation of women. If female choice is a key component of evolutionary success what impact does the constraint of women's choices have on society? The elaborate courtship plots of 19th century Spanish novels with their fixation on suitors and selectors rivalry and seduction were attempts to grapple with the question of female agency in a patriarchal society. By reading Darwin through the lens of the Spanish realist novel and vice versa Travis Landry brings new insights to our understanding of both: while Darwin's theories have often been seen as biologically deterministic Landry asserts that Darwin's theory of sexual selection was characterized by an open ended dynamic whose oxymoronic emphasis on ""passive"" female choice carries the potential for revolutionary change in the status of women."

Fruitful Embraces,Romance,Sexuality and justice often seem odd bedfellows. Sexual embraces of intimacy and passion thrive in our private lives while justice safeguards the laws and duties that govern the public realm. Yet intuitively we sense there are deeper connections. Both sexuality and justice support the holistic ideal proclaimed by the early Christian writer Ireneaus: the glory of God is the human person fully alive. Evelyn and James Whitehead combine professional expertise as a psychologist and historian of religion as well as personal experiences and extensive research to explore the interplay of sexuality love and justice on the spiritual journey today. While drawing on biblical themes and contemporary psychological insight the Whiteheads examine modern experiences of attachment and vulnerability marriage and friendship compassion and sexual diversity and the psychological and spiritual experiences of transgender persons-a new and often bewildering consideration for many Christians. Included is a reflection on a prophetic Christian ministry in support of sexuality and justice that illustrates the importance of moral awareness and sensual attunement to the world. Fruitful Embraces utilizes Christian theology and effective pastoral ministry to explore the vital connections between sexuality and Christian spirituality and links between compassion and justice that will encourage anyone on a spiritual journey to open their hearts and minds to the extravagant diversity of creation.
The English Novel in History 1700-1780,Romance,The English Novel in History 1700-1780 provides students with specific contexts for the early novel in response to a new understanding of eigtheenth-century Britain. It traces the social and moral representations of the period in extended readings of the major novelists as well as evaluatiing the importance of lesser known ones. John Richetti traces the shifting subject matter of the novel discussing: * scandalous and amatory fictions * criminal narratives of the early part of the century * the more disciplined realistic and didactic strain that appears in the 1740's and 1750's * novels promoting new ideas about the nature of domestic life * novels by women and how they relate to the shift of subject matter This original and useful book revises traditional literary history by considering novels from those years in the context of the transformation of Britain in the eighteenth century.
The Billionaire's Lost and Found Love,Romance,Hot and single hotel heir Cole Belmont wants more than anything to honor his dying father’s last wish to see him settle down with the love of his life. But love will never be on the agenda for him again since his ex-fiancée Hope Morgan walked out of his life and fled Belmont three years ago—without so much as a reason why along with any dreams Cole had of true love and happily ever after. But when Hope mysteriously returns his whole world is turned upside down again. Can Cole ever forgive her? Hope Morgan has messed up in her life—really bad. She’s fleeing from her past. A dark secret threatens to ruin her chances for a future of happiness with any man but it is Cole Belmont she really wants. Hope returns to Belmont with her young daughter but she still can’t come clean about what she did many years earlier…lives could be ruined—including Cole’s. Is it true that “all you need is love”? Can love keep Cole and Hope together and protect her from her dark past?
Tilting at Tradition,Romance,Don Quijote and Le Berger extravagant criticize fiction but come in the shape of novels. Far from breaking with their respective traditions they engage with the chivalric and the pastoral in a creative manner. Genre and imitation are key notions for assessing the status of the novels within literary history and the œuvres of Cervantes and Sorel. With emphasis on the continuity of each writer’s approach Le Berger extravagant is considered in the context of Sorel’s aim to educate readers and avoid romance stereotypes while the Quijote is read as an individual take on the chivalric novel rejecting the Spanish tradition in favor of the ironic Italian romanzo cavalleresco. Like Cervantes’ Galatea and Persiles Don Quijote reflects a specific tradition which in turn serves to illuminate the famous book. This study offers interpretations of the two novels but extends its scope toward the authors’ other works and additional contemporary sources including Avellaneda’s 1614 continuation of Don Quijote.
Captivity & Sentiment,Romance,"In a radically new interpretation and synthesis of highly popular 18th- and 19th-century genres Michelle Burnham examines the literature of captivity and using Homi Bhabha's concept of interstitiality as a base provides a valuable redescription of the ambivalent origins of the US national narrative. Stories of colonial captives sentimental heroines or fugitive slaves embody a ""binary division between captive and captor that is based on cultural national or racial difference"" but they also transcend these pre-existing antagonistic dichotomies by creating a new social space and herein lies their emotional power. Beginning from a simple question on why captivity particularly that of women so often inspires a sentimental response Burnham examines how these narratives elicit both sympathy and pleasure. The texts carry such great emotional impact precisely because they ""traverse those very cultural national and racial boundaries that they seem so indelibly to inscribe. Captivity literature like its heroines constantly negotiates zones of contact"" and crossing those borders reveals new cultural paradigms to the captive and ultimately the reader."
Reclaiming the Archive,Romance,Scholars of film history and feminist studies will appreciate the breadth of work in this volume.
Love American Style,Romance,A popular subject in sociology and cultural studies divorce has until recently been overlooked by literary critics. Spanning nearly a century during which the divorce rate skyrocketed Love American Style traces the treatment of divorce in the American novel. This book draws upon popular sociological political and architectural history to illustrate how divorce reflects conflicting ideologies and notions of American identity. Focusing primarily on work by William Dean Howells Edith Wharton Mary McCarthy and John Updike Kimberly Freeman delineates a system of tropes particular to divorce in American novels such as the association of divorce with the West and modernity the dismantling of the home and the disruption of the boundary between the public and the private. These tropes suggest a literary tradition of love marriage and divorce that is central to twentieth century American fiction. Offering an explanation for both the treatment of divorce in the American novel as well as its predominance in American culture this book should appeal to scholars of American literature and popular culture or anyone interested in how divorce has become so 'American'.

Gothic,Romance,Botting expertly introduces the transformations of the gothic through history discussing key figures such as ghosts monsters and vampires as well as tracing its origins characteristics cultural significance and critical interpretations.
Satire in Narrative,Romance,Virtually all theories of satire define it as a criticism of contemporary society. Some argue that satire criticizes the present in favor of a standard of values that has been superseded and thus that satire is generally backward-looking and conservative. While this is often true of poetic satire in this study Frank Palmeri asserts that narrative satire performs a different function that it parodies both the established view of the world and that of its opponents offering its own distinctive critical perspective. This theory of satire builds on the idea of dialogical parody in the work of Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin while revising Bakhtin's estimate of carnival. In Palmeri's view the carnivalesque offers only an inverted mirror image of authoritative discourse while parodic narrative satire suggests an alternative to both the official world and its inverted opposite. Palmeri applies this theory of narrative satire to five works of world literature each of which has generated sharp controversy about the genre to which it rightly belongs: Petronius' Satyricon Jonathan Swift's A Tale of a Tub Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Herman Melville's The Confidence-Man and Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49. He analyzes the features that link these works and shows how the changing pairs of alternatives that are parodied in these satires reflect changes in the terms of social and cultural oppositions. Satire in Narrative will appeal to comparatists specialists in eighteenth-century and American literature and others interested in theories of genre and the relations between literary forms and social history.
Heart Of Courage (The Heart Trilogy Book 3),Romance,"Under the pert pen name ""Lady Smart"" opinionated Lindsey Graham crusades for social change among London's elite writing for the ladies' gazette Heart to Heart."
Australian Languages,Romance,This book addresses controversial issues in the application of the comparative method to the languages of Australia which have recently come to international prominence. Are these languages ‘different’ in ways that challenge the fundamental assumptions of historical linguistics? Can subgrouping be successfully undertaken using the Comparative Method? Is the genetic construct of a far-flung ‘Pama-Nyungan’ language family supportable by classic methods of reconstruction? Contrary to increasingly established views of the Australian scene this book makes a major contribution to the demonstration that traditional methods can indeed be applied to these languages. These studies introduced by chapters on subgrouping methodology and the history of Australian linguistic classification rigorously apply the comparative method to establishing subgroups among Australian languages and justifying the phonology of Proto-Pama-Nyungan. Individual chapters can profitably be read either for their contribution to Australian linguistic prehistory or as case studies in the application of the comparative method.

Postethnic Narrative Criticism,Romance,"Magical realism has become almost synonymous with Latin American fiction but this way of representing the layered and often contradictory reality of the topsy-turvy late-capitalist globalizing world finds equally vivid expression in U.S. multiethnic and British postcolonial literature and film. Writers and filmmakers such as Oscar ""Zeta"" Acosta Ana Castillo Julie Dash Hanif Kureishi and Salman Rushdie have made brilliant use of magical realism to articulate the trauma of dislocation and the legacies of colonialism that people of color experience in the postcolonial multiethnic world. This book seeks to redeem and refine the theory of magical realism in U.S. multiethnic and British postcolonial literature and film. Frederick Aldama engages in theoretically sophisticated readings of Ana Castillo's So Far from God Oscar ""Zeta"" Acosta's Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children Shame The Satanic Verses and The Moor's Last Sigh Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust and Stephen Frears and Hanif Kureishi's Sammy and Rosie Get Laid. Coining the term ""magicorealism"" to characterize these works Aldama not only creates a postethnic critical methodology for enlarging the contact zone between the genres of novel film and autobiography but also shatters the interpretive lens that traditionally confuses the transcription of the real world where truth and falsity apply with narrative modes governed by other criteria."

Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture,Romance,Through analyses of a wide range of Chinese literary and visual texts from the beginning of the twentieth century through the contemporary period the thirteen essays in this volume challenge the view that canonical and popular culture are self-evident and diametrically opposed categories and instead argue that the two cultural sensibilities are inextricably bound up with one another. An international line up of contributors present detailed analyses of literary works and other cultural products that have previously been neglected by scholars while also examining more familiar authors and works from provocative new angles.The essays include investigations into the cultural industries and contexts that produce the canonical and popular the position of contemporary popular works at the interstices of nostalgia and amnesia and also the ways in which cultural texts are inflected with gendered and erotic sensibilities while at the same time also functioning as objects of desire in its own right. As the only volume of its kind to cover the entire span of the 20th century and also to consider the interplay of popular and canonical literature in modern China with comparable rigor Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture is an important resource for students and scholars of Chinese literature and culture.

Masculinity and Italian Cinema,Romance,Headline: A study of how Italian films re-envisage male identity in response to sexual liberationBlurb: Italian cinema has traditionally used the trope of an inadequate man in crisis to reflect on the country's many social and political upheavals. Masculinity and Italian Cinema examines how this preoccupation with male identity becomes especially acute in the 1970s when a set of more diverse and inclusive images of men emerge in response to the rise of feminism and gay liberation. Through an analysis of the way Italian films explore anxieties about male sexuality and femininity the book shows how such anxieties also intersect with particular preoccupations about national identity and political engagement. This is an essential study-tool to understand the multiple constructions of masculinity in Italian cinema helping students and researchers to understand the work of some of Italy's most provocative filmmakers.Key Features* Re-examines key Italian films including Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist Ettore Scola's A Special Day Pier Paolo Pasolini's Theorem and Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi in the light of gender and queer theory.* Covers the major thematic concerns genres and stylistic traits of 1970s Italian political cinema* Analyses the broader cultural context of 1970s Italy including sections on Italian feminism Gay liberation and the post-'68 social movements.Key Words: Gender; Queer; Body; Gay; Feminism; Pier Paolo Pasolini; Bernardo Bertolucci; Lina Wertmuller; Nanni Moretti; Federico Fellini; Ettore Scola; Marco Ferreri.

Split Auxiliary Systems,Romance,The alternation between the auxiliaries BE and HAVE which this collection examines is often discussed in connection with generative analyses of split intransitivity. But this book's purpose is to place the phenomenon in a broader context. Well-known facts in the Romance and Germanic language families are extended with data from lesser studied languages and dialects (Romanian Paduan) and also with experimental and historical data. Moreover the book goes beyond the usual language families in which the phenomenon has been studied with the inclusion of two chapters on Chinese and Korean. The theoretical background of the contributors is also broad ranging from current Generative approaches to Cognitive and Optimality-Theoretical frameworks. Readers interested in the structural historical developmental or experimental aspects of auxiliary selection should profit from this book's comprehensive empirical coverage and from the plurality of contemporary linguistic analyses it contains.
Structuring Sense: Volume III: Taking Form,Romance,Structuring Sense explores the difference between words however defined and structures however constructed. It sets out to demonstrate over three volumes that the explanation of linguistic competence should be shifted from lexical entry to syntactic structure from memory of words to manipulation of rules. Its reformulation of how grammar and lexicon interact has profound implications for linguistic philosophical and psychological theories about human mind and language. Hagit Borer departs from language specific constructional approaches and from lexicalist approaches to argue that universal hierarchical structures determine interpretation and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material. Taking Form the third and final volume of Structuring Sense applies this radical approach to the construction of complex words. Integrating research in syntax and morphology the author develops a new model of word formation arguing that on the one hand the basic building blocks of language are rigid semantic and syntactic functions while on the other hand they are roots which in themselves are but packets of phonological information and are devoid of both meaning and grammatical properties of any kind. Within such a model syntactic category syntactic selection and argument structure are all mediated through syntactic structures projected from rigid functions or alternatively constructed through general combinatorial principles of syntax such as Chomsky's Merge. The meaning of 'words' in turn does not involve the existence of lexemes but rather the matching of a well-defined and phonologically articulated syntactic domain with conceptual Content itself outside the domain of language as such. In a departure from most current models of syntax but in line with many philosophical traditions then the Exo-Skeletal model partitions 'meaning' into formal functions on the one hand and Content on the other hand. While the former are read off syntactico-semantic structures as is usually assumed Content is crucially read off syntactico-phonological structures.
Gender and Labour in Korea and Japan,Romance,"Bringing together for the first time sexual and industrial labour as the means to understand gender work and class in modern Japan and Korea this book shows that a key feature of the industrialisation of these countries was the associated development of a modern sex labour industry. Tying industrial and sexual labour together the book opens up a range of key questions: In what economy do we place the labour of the former ""comfort women""? Why have sex workers not been part of the labour movements of Korea and Japan? Why is it difficult to be ""working-class"" and ""feminine""? What sort of labour hierarchies operate in hostess clubs? How do financial crises translate into gender crises? This book explores how sexuality is inscribed in working-class identities and traces the ways in which sexual and labour relations have shaped the cultures of contemporary Japan and Korea. It addresses important historical episodes such as the Japanese colonial industrialisation of Korea wartime labour mobilisation women engaged in forced sex work for the Japanese army throughout the Asian continent and issues of ethnicity and sex in the contemporary workplace. The case studies provide specific examples of the way gender and work have operated across a variety of contexts including Korean shipyard unions Japanese hostess clubs and the autobiographical literature of Korean factory girls. Overall this book provides a compelling account of the entanglement of sexual and industrial labour throughout the twentieth century and shows clearly how ideas about gender have contributed in fundamental ways to conceptions of class and worker identities."
Leadership Coaching and Followership,Romance,This volume presents evidence-based ideas on all three converging forces to suit an array of individuals and their organisations. The volume is thick with evidence detail and case studies that the reader can draw upon and apply to their own situations. ​ Defining exactly what is leadership has been a persistent problem for researchers and theorists. Discovering how to create or produce leaders likewise has been a difficult challenge over the years. Written by an academic executive and coach the author focuses on three important converging aspects: leadership followership and coaching. Focus on leaders is disproportionate to what actually occurs within most organisations especially the relationship between the leader and the followers. That leadership is tantamount with being in control of a situation is challenged together with the belief that leadership capability is primarily shaped in line with a set of success criteria. The coach plays a significant part in this process although rarely visible.
Performing Economic Thought,Romance,This study examines the structural similarities between English mercantile treatises and drama c1600-1642. Bradley D. Ryner analyses the representational conventions of plays and mercantile treatises written between the chartering of the English East India Company in 1600 and the closing of the public playhouses at the outset of the English Civil War in 1642. He shows that playwrights' manipulation of specific elements of theatrical representation - such as metaphor props dramatic character stage space audience interaction and genre - exacerbated the tension between the aspects of the world taken into account by a particular representation and those aspects that it neglects.

Ceremony and Civility in English Renaissance Prose,Romance,Ceremony and Civility in English Renaissance Prose analyzes the emergence of civil prose in texts of the early modern period and defends English Renaissance writers against the current attack on their aristocratic politics. Using Thomas More's History of King Richard III Philip Sydney's Defense of Poetry Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity and Thomas Browne's Religio Medici Anne Hall demonstrates the emerging differentiation of civil and ceremonial prose in the early modern period. These works combine ceremonial discourse acknowledging such traditional values as a God-centered world and civil prose with its circumspections and irony thus revealing a philosophical awareness of the complexity of moral and political questions. Since the 1970s there have been two chief arguments about Renaissance literature. The first is that most Renaissance writers used traditional forms to bolster authority and that they should be regarded with suspicion. The second is that some Renaissance writers altered traditional forms to subvert authority and that they should be admired. Anne Hall contends that there is an alternative position--that many Renaissance writers used tradition to bolster authority and that their versions of tradition and authority deserve a defense that responds to current attacks on their racism violence and colonialist repression in texts that were once thought to be about love and education. Hall argues that Renaissance writers could not foresee the ways in which they would need to defend their position against Enlightenment attack and she supplies what she believes would have been their defense concluding that such Renaissance discourse must not be considered solely on a historical basis but also from a philosophical viewpoint.

Unmanly Men,Romance,"New Testament scholars typically assume that the men who pervade the pages of Luke's two volumes are models of an implied ""manliness."" Scholars rarely question how Lukan men measure up to ancient masculine mores even though masculinity is increasingly becoming a topic of inquiry in the field of New Testament and its related disciplines. Drawing especially from gender-critical work in classics Brittany Wilson addresses this lacuna by examining key male characters in Luke-Acts in relation to constructions of masculinity in the Greco-Roman world. Of all Luke's male characters Wilson maintains that four in particular problematize elite masculine norms: namely Zechariah (the father of John the Baptist) the Ethiopian eunuch Paul and above all Jesus. She further explains that these men do not protect their bodily boundaries nor do they embody corporeal control two interrelated male gender norms. Indeed Zechariah loses his ability to speak the Ethiopian eunuch is castrated Paul loses his ability to see and Jesus is put to death on the cross. With these bodily ""violations"" Wilson argues Luke points to the all-powerful nature of God and in the process reconfigures--or refigures--men's own claims to power. Luke however not only refigures the so-called prerogative of male power but he refigures the parameters of power itself. According to Luke God provides an alternative construal of power in the figure of Jesus and thus redefines what it means to be masculine. Thus for Luke ""real"" men look manifestly unmanly. Wilson's findings in Unmanly Men will shatter long-held assumptions in scholarly circles and beyond about gendered interpretations of the New Testament and how they can be used to understand the roles of the Bible's key characters."

Shakespeare and the Italian Renaissance,Romance,Shakespeare and the Italian Renaissance investigates the works of Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists from within the context of the European Renaissance and more specifically from within the context of Italian cultural dramatic and literary traditions with reference to the impact and influence of classical coeval and contemporary culture. In contrast to previous studies the critical perspectives pursued in this volume’s tripartite organization take into account a wider European intertextual dimension and above all an ideological interpretation of the 'aesthetics' or 'politics' of intertextuality. Contributors perceive the presence of the Italian world in early modern England not as a traditional treasure trove of influence and imitation but as a potential cultural force consonant with complex processes of appropriation transformation and ideological opposition through a continuous dialectical interchange of compliance and subversion.
Cross-Linguistic Studies of Imposters and Pronominal Agreement,Romance,Imposters are third person DPs that are used to refer to the speaker/writer or addressee such as : (i) Your humble servant finds the time before our next encounter very long. (ii) This reporter thinks that the current developments are extraordinary. (iii) Daddy will be back before too long. (iv) The present author finds the logic of the reply faulty. This volume explores verbal and pronominal agreement with imposters from a cross-linguistic perspective. The central questions for any given language are: (a) How do singular and plural imposters agree with the verb? (b) When a pronoun has an imposter antecedent what are the phi-features of the pronoun? The volume reveals a remarkable degree of variation in the answers to these questions but also reveals some underlying generalizations. The contributions describe imposters in Bangla Spanish Albanian Indonesian Italian French Romanian Mandarin and Icelandic.

The Wind from Heaven's Window,Romance,This collection is a combination of romantic philosophic mystical and spiritual poetry written to warm even the coldest of hearts. They come from a very inspired place that speaks of a great desire to understand ourselves. The elusive butterfly in all of us that out of its innate curiosity to learn and experience things by necessity transforms itself. They also speak of the unique place that we all share in the divine tapestry we call life and how we are all intimately connected. The poems reflect on the betrayal and hypocrisy that we all inevitably encounter on our journey through life. Most importantly a message of hope and joy runs through them so that we are always reminded that even in our darkest moments the light of truth and love has never abandoned us. The book also shares some of the stories that inspired and motivated some of the poems. They run the gamut from gut-wrenching tearjerkers to deeply impassioned pleas for universal kindness to the whimsical frolic of a playful little child. Included is a section titled Musings on Life. These are philosophic perspectives intended to be life lessons for the reader. It's been said that not all men are masters but all masters have been men. Along that same line of thinking the author feels that although not all philosophers are poets all poets are philosophers.
The Business of Common Life,Romance,"Deriving his theoretical model from systems theory and the Frankfurt school David Kaufmann argues that the consolidation of economic theory and the critical acceptance of the novel in late Georgian Britain were central to the cultural work if describing and legitimating the commercial state and the society that sustained it. By juxtaposing political texts (from Hume to Mill) moral philosophy and classical economic theory (from Smith to Mill) and novels by Radcliffe Austen Scott and Shelley Kaufmann shows how these different discourses worry and attempt to think through the problems of justice and citizenship that mark liberalism and modernity. ""This is the most consistently interesting and coherently argued treatment of political economy and literature that I've read. It will find an audience among both literary historians and cultural critics. Indeed I predict that some of Kaufmann's formulations could influence the way this subject is addressed by future scholars. The Business of Common Life is a book that any student of the subject will have to read and consider carefully.""--Mary Poovey The Johns Hopkins University"

Beatrix Potter,Romance,Beatrix Potter was one of the inventors of the contemporary picture book and her small novels published at the turn of the twentieth century are still available and popular today. Writing in Code is the first book-length study of Potter's work and it covers the entire oeuvre examining all facets of her work in relation to her private life. Daphne Kutzer reveals the depth of the symbolism in Potter’s work and relates this to the issues of the author's own development as an independent woman and writer and her struggles with domesticity Unitarianism and the socio-political issues in late-19th and early-20th century England. Weaving the subtle themes inscribed in Potter's own stories with the concerns and temperament of the author who wrote them Kutzer exemplifies literary criticism as it can illuminate the breadth of allusion in children's literature.

Love Lines,Romance,Until something goes wrong we take our hearts for granted. Heart-Smart-Gurus inspired by long research point to that bright red Valentine in our chests pumping tirelessly and endlessly on our behalf. But one day textbook cardiagram wiggles veer off the chart and we are pronounced however gently cardiologically in-correct. We feel betrayed. We more or less thought we were doing everything right so whats gotten into our ticker that loyal lifeline friend? Time for one thing heart sore for another Hearts are only human after all. Whats a longevity-seeker to do especially if blessed with enough heart-health insurance to make high-tech opportunities breakdownaffordable? The concept of preventing heart ache arresting it or reversing it is Valentines number one topic. For me its a question of flat out prevention to heal the heart emotionally via a softening process designed to protect the precious pump. Accumulation of blockage is what causes arterial malfunction. Deprived of emotional oxygen our own hearts cannot dilate freely. Regular exercise may prevent an attack and insure loves longevity. Superman has nobody doesnt need a seat belt nor even a plane. Are you flying solo? Be a friend. Find a lover. No man is an island. A centuries-old someone pointed out: Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief. When needed good friends give major doses of encouragement on short notice as do family supporters when trouble finds us. A circle of wagons is a supreme conductor for immediate shelter against stray enemy arrows. The John Wayne strong silent type I dont need anybody and men dont show love mentality isnt macho man but flat out stupid! In this writers paraphrase Samuel Johnson admonished If a man does not renew his friendships and make new acquaintances he finds himself playing alone as he grows too-soon old and too-late smart. One must keep friendships in constant repair. Has your friendship grown distant worn thin been allowed to slip away? Do a bit of friendship repair with a welcome oil-change and a few new points and plugs. Invite a friend or lover to do lunch: Whatever it takes fix it: Whatever it needs mend it: Whenever it bleeds move on to a more worthy and willing recipient of your hearts affections. An old Scottish proverb states He who ceases to be your friend never was a good one. In other words with friends like you who needs enemies? While youre at it start at home with your significant other. Maintain this key friendship when it warrants home-improvement. Remember your mate reads you like a book which ought not be a mystery novel. Perhaps you need to uncover the tinfoil to let her read the introduction and to truly reveal your heart by allowing her not just to scan but to study all its pages. A woman who is allowed this look-see inside her mates heart is the one who becomes and remains your life-long best friend partner and home companion. A Promise Keeper fueled by faith fired with compassion and true to God achieves unconditional passions for love of life love of wife of relatives and friends co-workers and parishioners and has love to spare even for enemies. So turn the other cheek. The other kiss may be love-saving. To have a friend is to be one; its the beginning of relationships that lead to loves: paternal filial (described as fraternal) as in Philadelphia (city of brotherly love) and Eros even if the arrows point in alternate-lifestyle directions and sex without love or marriage. Agape love of course is the ultimate love of our Creator for his Creation leading to Eternal Love if you will that Father-God promises His children. To love one another as He loves us is not a request but a command from the Nurturer who furnishes the glue to make it stick. Can you buy love? Sure if youre shopping for a convenient kind tried and untrue. You can only earn respect by modeling love. It is o

The Form of American Romance,Romance,"Originally published in 1988. Edgar Dryden challenges recent criticism that has tended to discredit—or at least devalue—the importance of ""romance"" as a thematic and generic category of American fiction. In The Form of American Romance he examines its evolution and meaning through readings of five exemplary texts: Hawthorne's Marble Faun Melville's Pierre James's Portrait of a Lady Faulkner's Absalom Absalom! and Barth's Letters. Each of these novels treats the problems of reading and writing in a self-referential way that reflects on the questions they dramatize and Dryden has chosen each with the others in mind. Taken together they chart a line of development with representative examples of what literary history calls romanticism realism modernism and postmodernism and thus they suggest a certain story about the continuity of the American novel."

Thriller,Thriller,"The blurry line between mysteries and thrillers gets even fuzzier in this outstanding anthology of 32 new stories by top genre names such as Lee Child James Grippando Denise Hamilton and David Morrell. Patterson in his introduction talks about the ""intensity of emotions"" that thrillers share - as well as ""the force with which they hurtle the reader along."" This description fits such fine efforts as Gayle Lynds's ""The Hunt for Dmitri"" which takes the heroine of The Coil Liz Sansborough into an adventure involving her father the infamous CIA assassin known as the Carnivore. But other extremely readable stories like Alex Kava's ""Goodnight Sweet Mother"" would qualify as straight mystery. Readers who favor one category or another may at first be a bit baffled but lovers of crime fiction in general and well-told action tales in particular will be well rewarded. Would-be thriller writers can learn a lot about research and technique from Patterson's introductions to each story."

State Violence and Moral Horror,Horror,"Can state violence ever be morally justified? In State Violence and Moral Horror Jeremy Arnold critically engages a wide variety of arguments both canonical and contemporary arguing that there can be no justification. Drawing on the concept of singularity found in the work of French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy Arnold demonstrates that any attempt to justify state violence will itself be violent and therefore must fail as a justification. On the basis of this argument the book explores the concept of ""moral horror"" as the experience of living amidst and acquiescing to unjustifiable state violence. The careful explanation of arguments from across the spectrum of political theory and exceptionally clear prose will enable both advanced undergraduates and more general readers interested in political thought to understand and engage the central argument. State Violence and Moral Horror is a unique contribution to the growing literature on violence and will be of interest to political theorists and philosophers in both the analytic and continental traditions philosophers of law international relations theorists law and society scholars and social scientists interested in normative aspects of state violence."
Anni 80 Il Decennio d’oro del Cinema Horror,Horror,Il presente libro nasce come tentativo di sintetico catalogo ragionato del cinema horror degli anni 80 compiuto da uno spettatore che nel 1980 aveva cinque anni e nel 1990 quindici quindi uno spettatore fortemente influenzabile e che pertanto risente nei giudizi delle proprie memorie di giovane testimone delle paure e delle inquietudini che le tematiche horror gli trasmettevano. L'approccio ai film avviene pertanto su basi fortemente affettive e nostalgiche. L'angolo di prospettiva seguito è francamente unilaterale: non si è voluto rifare qui una storia generale ed approfondita del cinema horror dal 1980 al 1990 ma verificare l'influenza diretta delle varie tematiche sulla produzione internazionale le imitazioni del passato e gli indirizzi e le nuove mete indicate dai maestri quali Tobe Hooper Wes Craven Kubrick Carpenter ect. ect.. Così analizzando le varie tematiche e le piccole o grandi ideologie che esse trasmettono potremo ritrovare alcuni tratti tipici di fortunatissimi filoni quali Halloween Venerdì 13 solo per citare i più importanti. Inoltre un viaggio nel Cinema Horror degli anni 80 analizzato sotto un profilo laico ed il profilo religioso prettamente cattolico. Diversificazioni di analisi certo ma un sicuro approfondimento delle tematiche che ci interessano. Infatti di tutti i film presi in considerazione non solo si dà un sintetico giudizio laico ma si riporta anche l’approfondita Scheda redatta dal Centro Cattolico Cinematografico che analizza la trama valuta il film sotto il profilo etico-morale-religioso al fine di indicare ai Cattolici se può essere visto o meno. Ne viene fuori uno spaccato veramente interessante e a volte addirittura divertente. Bisogna dare atto però che la critica cattolica sa diversificare il giudizio religioso da quello tecnico-creativo. Ciò vuol dire che un film può essere riconosciuto come un capolavoro ma non per questo ottenere il nulla osta di visibilità. Il libro è stato concepito per l’editoria elettronica è come tale ha delle peculiarità che il libro cartaceo non ha. La principale è quella della interattività. Non indispensabile ma opportuna. Disponendo di una connessione internet sul proprio lettore di ebook sarà possibile collegarsi ad esempio a Wikipedia potendo così consultare una scheda approfondita del film e del suo regista. Inoltre subito dopo l’introduzione si riportano tutti i film horror usciti dal 1980 al 1989 linkati a IMDB e a MRQE per le recensioni in lingua inglese.

Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction,Horror,Horror an increasingly popular subject for books television and movies is especially appealing to teenagers who are enthusiastic fans of ghouls and gore. The appeal of horror literature to young adults cannot be denied or ignored and in Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction the first genre study in the Twayne Young Adult Authors Series Cosette Kies concentrates on teenage interest in the field. Dr. Kies reminds us that the supernatural has a long literary tradition including such works as Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights Henry James's The Turn of the Screw and Edgar Allan Poe's short stories. Against this literary background Dr. Kies takes a witty and perceptive look at contemporary manifestations of horror fiction highlighting those authors that teenagers particularly enjoy. Writers such as V.C. Andrews Dean Koontz John Saul Anne Rice Chelsea Quinn Yarbro Robert Bloch Robert MacCammon and of course Stephen King are examined in depth. Each chapter includes an introduction that touches on historical antecedents a chronology of biographical highlights and major works for the subject author and a long quote that allows the writer's individual voice to shed light on his or her literary philosophy. Dr. Kies analyzes theme plot and character for the major works with perception and skill. Separate chapters explore the appeal of satanism for young adults in novels such as The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby and there is an irreverent look at a recent development in horror writing--splatterpunk. Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction is a welcome addition for all those interested in horror literature and will also provide much-needed information for librarians teachers and parents who want to understand why young adults love horror literature.

Film Folklore and Urban Legends,Horror,"From Alien to When a Stranger Calls many films are based on folklore or employ an urban legend element to propel the narrative. But once those traditional aspects have been identified do they warrant further scrutiny? Indeed why is the study of folklore in popular film important? In Films Folklore and Urban Legends Mikel J. Koven addresses this issue by exploring the convergence of folklore with popular cinema studies. Well beyond the identification of traditional motifs in popular cinema Koven reveals new paradigms of filmic analysis which open up when one looks at movies through the lens of folklore. In particular this book focuses on the study of urban legends and how these narratives are used as inspiration for a number of films. Divided into five sections the book begins with a general survey of the existing literature on folklore/film predominantly from the perspective of folklore studies. Subsequent chapters address discourses of belief how urban legends provide the organizing principle of some films and how certain films ""act out"" or perform a legend. Movies discussed in this book include Alligator Candyman The Curve Dead Man on Campus I Know What You Did Last Summer Urban Legend Weekend at Bernie's and The Wicker Man as well as zombie films killer bee movies and slasher films (including Halloween Black Christmas The Burning and Terror Train). Koven also devotes attention to key television shows such as The X-Files and Most Haunted. In his analysis Koven explains not only how film and television narratives are built upon already-existing popular culture beliefs but also how films and television shows recycle those beliefs back into popular culture. Taken as a whole Film Folklore and Urban Legends both stands on its own as the first book-length study of folklore and popular cinema and as an introductory textbook for the study of folklore and film."

Nostalgia Or Perversion?,Horror,"Nostalgia or Perversion? Gothic Rewriting from the Eighteenth Century until the Present Day presents an interdisciplinary approach to an important aspect of Gothic texts films and music: that of rewriting. From the eighteenth-century Gothic novel to present-day vampire films and Goth music the genre is characterised by its nostalgic reflection on past worlds narratives and identities. Gothic nostalgia is often accompanied by a transgressive drive resulting in perversions of the rewritten pastâ ""the modern vampire is no longer embodied evil but an attractive dandy while Goth subcultures reflect on Victorian aesthetics but pervert them by adding fetishist elements. Gothic nostalgia transforms the past turning it upside down foregrounding its background and corrupting its order. In this volume an international group of philosophy literature film and music scholars investigates the instrumental role of nostalgia and perversion in the Gothicâ (TM)s rewriting of the past. If elements of both nostalgia and perversion are operative in Gothic rewriting how are they connected? How do they play out in differing media? How do they change audiencesâ (TM) views on the relationships between binaries such as past and present other and self and norm and deviation? Nostalgia or Perversion brings together the early Gothic novel present-day female and black Gothic literature Goth subculture and music and the imagery of horror films and comic books thus broadening the definition of â ~Gothicâ (TM) from a literary genre to a gesture of pervasive cultural criticism. The interdisciplinary analysis of nostalgia and perversion in Gothic rewriting uncovers wholly new insights into the artistic and social functions of the Gothic making the volume useful to both scholars and students. As the essays reflect on academic as well as popular texts and media it is also accessible to general readers. Nostalgia or Perversion provides a sophisticated analysis of how the Gothic radically rewrites the past not as nostalgia but as a calculated act of transgression. The past and how its reconstructions break down the boundaries between real and unreal and normal and abnormal is examined across a range of different media including novels films comic books television and music. The essays in this collection also address how this issue shapes Gothic formulations of race sexuality and gender. Both ambitious in scope and focused and rigorous in its analysis this book provides a critically important re-evaluation of the Gothic tradition. â ""Andrew Smith University of Glamorgan (UK)."

Hysteria Trauma and Melancholia,Horror,Hysteria trauma and melancholia have not only become powerful tropes in modern-day culture at large; they are also prominent in the theatre. How do contemporary plays employ these concepts? How does the staging of these 'disorders' affect the aesthetics of the plays? What exchange relations between theory and theatre can be traced? Christina Wald pursues such questions in this new study establishing the characteristics and concerns of 'The Drama of Hysteria' 'Trauma Drama' and 'The Drama of Melancholia' through in-depth readings of works by playwrights such as Anna Furse Jerry Johnson Sarah Daniels Phylis Nagy Claire Dowie David Auburn Marina Carr and Sarah Kane. Conceptualising hysteria trauma and melancholia as 'performative maladies' Wald educes an exciting interaction of theatrical performance psychiatric and psychoanalytic theory and the theory of gender performativity.

Sleeping With the Lights On,Horror,Four o'clock in the morning and the lights are on and still there's no way we're going to sleep not after the film we just saw. The book we just read. Fear is one of the most primal human emotions and one of the hardest to reason with and dispel. So why do we scare ourselves? It seems almost mad that we would frighten ourselves for fun and yet there are thousands of books films games and other forms of entertainment designed to do exactly that. As Darryl Jones shows the horror genre is huge. Ranging from vampires ghosts and werewolves to mad scientists Satanists and deranged serial killers the cathartic release of scaring ourselves has made its appearance in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to internet memes. Exploring the key tropes of the genre including its monsters its psychological chills and its love affair with the macabre Darryl Jones discusses why horror stories disturb us and how society responds to literary and film representations of the gruesome and taboo. Should the enjoyment of horror be regarded with suspicion? Are there different levels of the horrific and should we distinguish between the commonly reviled carnage of contemporary torture porn and the culturally acceptable bloodbaths of ancient Greek tragedies? Analysing the way in which horror manifests multiple personalities and has been used throughout history to articulate the fears and taboos of the current generation Jones considers the continuing evolution of the genre today. As horror is mass marketed to mainstream society in the form of romantic vampires and blockbuster hits it also continues to maintain its former shadowy presence on the edges of respectability as banned films and violent internet phenomena push us to question both our own preconceptions and the terrifying capacity of human nature.

Queer Horror,Horror,"From the beginning horror has been part of the cinema landscape. Despite some of the earliest genre films with gay directors such as F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu) and James Whale (Frankenstein The Invisible Man Bride of Frankenstein) LGBTQIA characters have rarely been portrayed in full view. For decades filmmakers have included ""coded"" content in their films with the homosexual experience translated into censor-friendly subtext for consumption by general audiences. Gradually LGBTQIA characters and themes have moved from the background to the foreground as the horror genre has grown along with its audience's tastes and attitudes. Likewise more and more LGBTQIA writers and directors have begun to offer their queer-centric takes on scary movies and today ""queer horror"" is a thriving film genre. With more than 900 entries this critical filmography is a comprehensive critical yet playful examination of the history of LGBTQIA content in horror films. Eight journalistic contributors dig into every era of scary movies including the early silents pre- and post-Hays Code content grindhouse sleaze LGBTQIA indies and megaplex studio releases. From Whale's The Old Dark House (1932) to Don Mancini's Chucky films and everything in between this collection explores what can be found at the intersection of ""LGBTQIA"" and ""horror"" in the film industry."

Halloween,Horror,This book argues that Halloween need not be the first nor the most influential youth slasher film for it to hold a special place in the history of youth cinema. John Carpenter’s 1978 horror hit was once considered the be-all end-all of teen slasher cinema and was regarded as the first the best and the most influential American slasher film. Recent revisions in film history however have challenged Halloween’s comfortable place in the canon of youth horror cinema. However this book argues that the film like no other draws from the themes imagery and obsessions that fueled youth horror cinema since the 1950s—Gothic atmosphere atomic dread twisted psychology and alienated teenage monsters—and ties them together in the deceptively simple story of a masked killer on Halloween night. Along the way the film delivers a savage critique of social institutions and their failure to protect young people. Halloween also depicts a cadre of compelling and complicated youth characters: teenage babysitters watching over preadolescents as a killer who is viciously avoiding the responsibilities of young adulthood stalks them through the shadows. This book explores all these aspects of Halloween including the franchise it spawned providing an invaluable insight into this iconic film for students and researchers alike.

Women Monstrosity and Horror Film,Horror,Women occupy a privileged place in horror film. Horror is a space of entertainment and excitement of terror and dread and one that relishes the complexities that arise when boundaries - of taste of bodies of reason - are blurred and dismantled. It is also a site of expression and exploration that leverages the narrative and aesthetic horrors of the reproductive the maternal and the sexual to expose the underpinnings of the social political and philosophical othering of women. This book offers an in-depth analysis of women in horror films through an exploration of 'gynaehorror' films concerned with all aspects of female reproductive horror from reproductive and sexual organs to virginity pregnancy birth motherhood and finally to menopause. Some of the themes explored include: the intersection of horror monstrosity and sexual difference; the relationships between normative female (hetero)sexuality and the twin figures of the chaste virgin and the voracious vagina dentata; embodiment and subjectivity in horror films about pregnancy and abortion; reproductive technologies monstrosity and 'mad science'; the discursive construction and interrogation of monstrous motherhood; and the relationships between menopause menstruation hagsploitation and 'abject barren' bodies in horror. The book not only offers a feminist interrogation of gynaehorror but also a counter-reading of the gynaehorrific that both accounts for and opens up new spaces of productive radical and subversive monstrosity within a mode of representation and expression that has often been accused of being misogynistic. It therefore makes a unique contribution to the study of women in horror film specifically while also providing new insights in the broader area of popular culture gender and film philosophy.

Horror movies as a part of American Popculture,Horror,Seminar paper from the year 2004 in the subject American Studies - Culture and Applied Geography grade: 20 Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald (Institut für Angelistik und Amerikanistik) course: American Beliefs and Popular Culture language: English abstract: “Fear is the most powerful emotion in the human race and fear of the unknown is probably the most ancient. You are dealing with stuff everybody has felt...If you are making a horror film you get to play with the audiences feelings.” John Carpenter Horror movies originate from fictional work that portrays the dark side of life with the primary aim of frightening and terrifying its audience. By presenting horrifying images of several incorporating sub-genres and repeated themes such as vampires and werewolves demonic possessions evil children cannibals and zombies alien invasion and mindcontrol film makers like John Carpenter create a world where the worst nightmares become true. According to the adolescents who are providing the genre’s target group monster movies always deal with the irresistible temptation of the unknown and forbidden and therefore shock with a horrific impact of terrifying elements. (...) Since horror and monster movies stand for an important part of the American film industry and with it of its popular culture throughout the last eight decades it is useful to look at the development of the horror genre in its historical and cultural context and thus to focus again on the question of interpretive perspective. As horror movies despite all obscurity still deal with real fears of a society or the urge to break with social conventions concentrating on the change of themes styles and characters of the genre means to learn more about the American collective consciousness and what was bothering a whole society during the 20th century.

They flicker on the screen of a darkened movie theater and are shared around the campfire. They blare out in tabloid true-crime headlines and in the worried voices of local news anchors. They are consumed virally on the phones in our pockets. Like the victims in any slasher movie worth its salt we can’t escape the thrall of scary stories. In American Scary noted cultural historian and Columbia professor Jeremy Dauber takes the reader to the startling origins of horror in the United States. Dauber draws a captivating through line that ties historical influences ranging from the Salem witch trials and enslaved-person narratives directly to the body of work we more closely associate with horror today: the weird tales of H. P. Lovecraft the lingering fiction of Shirley Jackson the disquieting films of Alfred Hitchcock the up-all-night stories of Stephen King and the gripping critiques of Jordan Peele. With the dexterous weave of insight and style that have made him one of America’s leading historians of popular culture Dauber makes the haunting case that horror reveals the true depths of the American mind."

A Place of Darkness,Horror,Horror is one of the most enduringly popular genres in cinema. The term “horror film” was coined in 1931 between the premiere of Dracula and the release of Frankenstein but monsters ghosts demons and supernatural and horrific themes have been popular with American audiences since the emergence of novelty kinematographic attractions in the late 1890s. A Place of Darkness illuminates the prehistory of the horror genre by tracing the way horrific elements and stories were portrayed in films prior to the introduction of the term “horror film.” Using a rhetorical approach that examines not only early films but also the promotional materials for them and critical responses to them Kendall R. Phillips argues that the portrayal of horrific elements was enmeshed in broader social tensions around the emergence of American identity and in turn American cinema. He shows how early cinema linked monsters ghosts witches and magicians with Old World superstitions and beliefs in contrast to an American way of thinking that was pragmatic reasonable scientific and progressive. Throughout the teens and twenties Phillips finds supernatural elements were almost always explained away as some hysterical mistake humorous prank or nefarious plot. The Great Depression of the 1930s however constituted a substantial upheaval in the system of American certainty and opened a space for the reemergence of Old World gothic within American popular discourse in the form of the horror genre which has terrified and thrilled fans ever since.
The Naked And The Undead,Horror,Horror is often dismissed as mass art or lowbrow entertainment that produces only short-term thrills. Horror films can be bloody gory and disturbing so some people argue that they have bad moral effects inciting viewers to imitate cinematic violence or desensitizing them to atrocities. In The Naked and the Undead: Evil and the Appeal of Horror Cynthia A. Freeland seeks to counter both aesthetic disdain and moral condemnation by focusing on a select body of important and revealing films demonstrating how the genre is capable of deep philosophical reflection about the existence and nature of evil—both human and cosmic. In exploring these films the author argues against a purely psychoanalytic approach and opts for both feminist and philosophical understandings. She looks at what it is in these movies that serves to elicit specific reactions in viewers and why such responses as fear and disgust are ultimately pleasurable. The author is particularly interested in showing how gender figures into screen presentations of evil.The book is divided into three sections: Mad Scientists and Monstrous Mothers which looks into the implications of male rationalistic scientific technology gone awry; The Vampire's Seduction which explores the attraction of evil and the human ability (or inability) to distinguish active from passive subject from object and virtue from vice; and Sublime Spectacles of Disaster which examines the human fascination with horror spectacle. This section concludes with a chapter on graphic horror films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Written for both students and film enthusiasts the book examines a wide array of films including: The Silence of the Lambs Repulsion Frankenstein The Fly Dead Ringers Alien Bram Stoker's Dracula Interview with the Vampire Frenzy The Shining Eraserhead Hellraiser and many others.

Ghost in the Well,Horror,"Ghost in the Well is the first study to provide a full history of the horror genre in Japanese cinema from the silent era to Classical period movies such as Nakagawa Nobuo's Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan (1959) to the contemporary global popularity of J-horror pictures like the Ring and Ju-on franchises. Michael Crandol draws on a wide range of Japanese language sources including magazines posters and interviews with directors such as Kurosawa Kiyoshi to consider the development of kaiki eiga the Japanese phrase meaning ""weird"" or ""bizarre"" films that most closely corresponds to Western understandings of ""horror"". He traces the origins of kaika eiga in Japanese kabuki theatre and traditions of the monstrous feminine showing how these traditional forms were combined with the style and conventions of Hollywood horror to produce an aesthetic that was both transnational and peculiarly Japanese. Ghost in the Well sheds new light on one of Japanese cinema's best-known genres while also serving as a fascinating case study of how popular film genres are re-imagined across cultural divides."
Italian Horror Cinema,Horror,In its heyday from the late 1950s until the early 1980s Italian horror cinema was characterised by an excess of gore violence and often incoherent plot-lines. Films about zombies cannibals and psychopathic killers ensured there was no shortage of controversy and the genre presents a seemingly unpromising nexus of films for sustained critical analysis. But Italian horror cinema with all its variations subgenres and filoni remains one of the most recognisable and iconic genre productions in Europe achieving cult status worldwide. One of the manifestations of a rich production landscape in Italian popular cinema after the Second World War Italian horror was also characterised by its imitation of foreign models and the transnational dimension of its production agreements as well as by its international locations and stars.This collection brings together for the first time a range of contributions aimed at a new understanding of the genre investigating the different phases in its history the peculiarities of the production system the work of its most representative directors (Mario Bava and Dario Argento) and the wider role it has played within popular culture.

POV Horror,Horror,Drawing together strands of film theory and psychology this book offers a fresh assessment of the found footage horror subgenre. It reconceptualizes landmark films--including The Blair Witch Project (1999) Cloverfield (2008) Paranormal Activity (2009) and Man Bites Dog (1992)--as depictions of the lived experience and social legacy of psychological trauma. The author demonstrates how the frantic cinematography and ambiguous formulation of the monster evokes the shocked and disoriented cognition of the traumatized mind. Moreover the frightening effect of trauma on society is shown to be a recurring theme across the subgenre. Close textual analysis is given to a wide range of films over several decades including titles that have yet to receive any academic attention. Divided into four distinct sections the book examines how found footage horror films represent the effects of historical and contemporary traumatic events on Western societies the vicarious spread of traumatic experiences via mass media the sublimation of domestic abuse into haunted houses and the viewer's identification with the monster as an embodiment of perpetrator trauma.

Contemporary Horror on Screen,Horror,This book highlights how horror in film and television creates platforms to address distinct areas of modern-day concern. In examining the prevalence of dark tropes in contemporary horror films such as Get Out Annabelle: Creation A Quiet Place Hereditary and The Nun as well as series such as Stranger Things American Horror Story and Game of Thrones amongst numerous others the authors contend that we are witnessing the emergence of a ‘horror renaissance’. They posit that horror films or programmes once widely considered to be a low form of popular culture entertainment can contain deeper meanings or subtext and are increasingly covering serious subject matter. This book thus explores how horror is utilised as a tool to explore social and political anxieties of the cultural moment and is thus presented as a site for contestation exploration and expansion to discuss present-day fears. It demonstrates how contemporary horror reflects the horror of modern-day life be it political biological social or environmental. A vital contribution to studies of the horror genre in contemporary culture and the effect it has on social anxieties in a threatening and seemingly apocalyptic time for the world this is a vital text for students and researchers in popular culture film television and media studies.

Mazes of the Serpent,Horror,In a compact readable and accessible book Roger B. Salomon explores the nature of horror in literature and in life. Rather than minimizing horror by narrowly associating it with psychological drives persecution or extremism he approaches horror through the medium of narrative as a significant and enduring physical and metaphysical reality. Salomon focuses on fictions of horror including eighteenth-century Gothic and nineteenth-century ghost stories. He does not however isolate literary examples from more general human issues including religious belief. Mazes of the Serpent takes up examples of horror from historical and personal narratives--including battle memoirs and Holocaust testimonies--as Salomon identifies certain common themes and qualities that cross the boundary between fiction and actual human experience.
Monstrous Possibilities,Horror,This book focuses on how the abject spectacle of the ‘monstrous feminine’ has been reimagined by recent and contemporary screen horrors focused on the desires and subjectivities of female monsters who as anti-heroic protagonists of revisionist and reflexive texts exemplify gendered possibility in altered cultures of 21st century screen production and reception. As Barbara Creed notes in a recent interview the patriarchal stereotype of horror that she named ‘the monstrous-feminine’ has decades later ‘embarked on a life of her own’. Focused on this altered and renewed form of female monstrosity this study engages with an international array of recent and contemporary screen entertainments from arthouse and indie horror films by emergent female auteurs to the franchised products of multimedia conglomerates to 'quality' television horror to the social media-based creations of horror fans working as ‘pro-sumers’. In this way the monograph in its organisation and scope maps the converged and rapidly changing environment of 21st century screen cultures in order to situate the monstrous female anti-hero as one of its distinctive products.

American culture and perception of women in horror movies,Horror,"Essay from the year 2012 in the subject American Studies - Culture and Applied Geography grade: A University of Malta language: English abstract: Horror genre has its origins in the gothic 19th century novels like Marry Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) or John Polidori’s The Vampire (1819). Even though horror movie is a typical European genre it has a long history in American cinema dating back to 1915 silent movie Les Vampires by Freuillade and to one of the first sound movies from 1931 Tod Browning’s famous Dracula. Horror movies may be put into three categories: ones that contain the supernatural elements in which vampires ghosts witchcraft appears; psychological horror which relies on characters’ fears their guilt or beliefs; and massacre movies with scenes of slaughter brutality and rough treatment (Cinema Studies 184). Although horror movies as an element of mass culture may be perceived as simplistic predictable lacking depth and simply being an unworthy for analysis there is a great deal of films that in its content reflect the contemporary problems that occurred in the American society. While many critics consider horror genre as a “low culture” one must not fail to notice that its significance is enormous. One can sense an inextricable link between film and social concerns since the role of the film is to project certain fears and concerns of contemporary society as well as to help people to resolve them. As Prawer observed: ""If the terror film is thus connected to our social concerns it also paradoxically helps us to cope with our ordinary life by jolting us out of it"" (60). A popular opinion has it that the popularity of horror movies increases along with the disturbance experienced by the society. Since the 20th century is perceived as the era of the constant social upheaval the history of the horror movie equals the history of the anxiety (Wells 3); hence the time the cultural chaos erupts the audience turns to horror movies as a means that liberates them from their anxiety. As Phillips asserts “anxiety tends to promote a sense of helplessness; fear on the other hand provides an impetus for change” (9). Thus the fear evoked by the slasher film one is forced to invent new ways of coping with his or her difficulties since a typical way of thinking will occur not only problematic but also troublesome."
The Philosophy of Horror Or Paradoxes of the Heart,Horror,"For decades the horror genre has been a major popular entertainment and has dominated the publishing and film industries. Yet there exists no philosophical examination of the genre - the time for its aesthetic analysis is ripe. Noel Carroll film scholar and philosopher offers the first serious look at the aesthetics of horror. In this book he discusses the nature and narrative structures of the genre dealing with horror as a ""transmedia"" phenomenon. A fan and serious student of the horror genre Carroll brings to bear his comprehensive knowledge of obscure and forgotten works as well as of the horror masterpieces. Working from a philosophical perspective he tries to account for how people can find pleasure in having their wits scared out of them. What after all are those ""paradoxes of the heart"" that make us want to be horrified?"

What's Eating You?,Horror,Divided into four thematic sections What's Eating You? explores the deeper significance of food on screen-the ways in which they reflect (or challenge) our deepest fears about consuming and being consumed. Among the questions it asks are: How do these films mock our taboos and unsettle our notions about the human condition? How do they critique our increasing focus on consumption? In what ways do they hold a mirror to our taken-for-granteds about food and humanity asking if what we eat truly matters? Horror narratives routinely grasp those questions and spin them into nightmares. Monstrous “others” dine on forbidden fare; the tables of consumption are turned and the consumer becomes the consumed. Overindulgence as Le Grande Bouffe (1973) and Street Trash (1987) warn can kill us and occasionally as films like The Stuff (1985) and Poultrygeist (2006) illustrate our food fights back. From Blood Feast (1963) to Sweeney Todd (2007) motion pictures have reminded us that it is an “eat or be eaten” world.
Monstrous Forms,Horror,"It makes us jump. It makes us scream. It haunts our nightmares. So why do we watch horror? Why do we play it?

Transnational Horror Across Visual Media,Horror,This volume investigates the horror genre across national boundaries (including locations such as Africa Turkey and post-Soviet Russia) and different media forms illustrating the ways that horror can be theorized through the circulation reception and production of transnational media texts. Perhaps more than any other genre horror is characterized by its ability to be simultaneously aware of the local while able to permeate national boundaries to function on both regional and international registers. The essays here explore political models and allegories questions of cult or subcultural media and their distribution practices the relationship between regional or cultural networks and the legibility of international horror iconography across distinct media. The book underscores how a discussion of contemporary international horror is not only about genre but about how genre can inform theories of visual cultures and the increasing permeability of their borders.
Cutting Edge,Horror,"Even before Jean-Luc Godard and other members of the French New Wave championed Hollywood B movies aesthetes and cineasts relished the raw emotions of genre films. This contradiction has been particularly true of horror cinema in which the same images and themes found in exploitation and splatter movies are also found in avant-garde and experimental films blurring boundaries of taste and calling into question traditional distinctions between high and low culture. In Cutting Edge Joan Hawkins offers an original and provocative discussion of taste trash aesthetics and avant-garde culture of the 1960s and 1970s to reveal horror's subversiveness as a genre. In her treatment of what she terms ""art-horror"" films Hawkins examines home viewing video collection catalogs and fanzines for insights into what draws audiences to transgressive films. Cutting Edged provides the first extended political critique of Yoko Ono's rarely seen Rape and shows how a film such as Franju's Eyes without a Face can work simultaneously as an art political and splatter film. The rediscovery of Tod Browning's Freaks as an art film the ""eurotrash"" cinema of Jess Franco camp cults like the one around Maria Montez and the ""cross-over"" reception of Andy Warhol's Frankenstein are all studied for what they reveal about cultural hierarchies. Looking at the low aspects of high culture and the high aspects of low culture Hawkins scrutinizes the privilege habitually accorded ""high"" art -- a tendency she argues that lets highbrow culture off the hook and removes it from the kinds of ethical and critical social discussions that have plagued horror and porn. Full of unexpected insights Cutting Edge calls fora rethinking of high/low distinctions -- and a reassigning of labels at the video store."
The Horror of It All,Horror,Pop culture history meets blood-soaked memoir as Adam Rockoff “a passionate fan of the horror genre in all its forms” (The New York Times) recalls a life spent watching blockbuster slasher films cult classics and everything in between. Horror films have simultaneously captivated and terrified audiences for generations racking up millions of dollars at the box office and infusing our nightmares with chainsaws goblins and blood-spattered machetes. Today’s hottest television shows feature classic horror elements from marauding zombies and sexy vampires to myriad incarnations of the devil himself. Yet the horror genre and its controversial offshoots continue to occupy a nebulous space in our critical dialogue. The Horror of It All is a memoir from the front lines of the horror industry that dissects (and occasionally defends) the massively popular phenomenon of scary movies. Author Adam Rockoff delivers “the sharpest pop culture criticism you’ll find in any medium today” (Rue Morgue) as he traces the highs and lows of the genre through the lens of his own obsessive fandom which began in the horror aisles of his childhood video store and continued with a steady diet of cable trash. From the convergence of horror and heavy metal to Siskel and Ebert’s crusade against the slasher flick to the legacy of the Scream franchise and the behind-the-scenes work of horror directors and make-up artists Rockoff mines the rich history of the genre braiding critical analysis with his own firsthand experiences as a horror writer and producer. Filled with mordant wit and sharp insight The Horror of It All “is an amiable and often amusing guide” (Kirkus Reviews) that explains why horror films not only endure but continue to prosper. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

Lurking Under the Surface,Horror,Horror can be a valuable conversation partner for the spiritual questions that animate so many of us. Whether through a movie television show novel or even myth horror as a genre has always spoken to our deepest human fears and anxieties: fear of death of the unknown of knowing too much. Whether you're looking at classic narratives like Frankenstein which shows us the consequences of stretching knowledge farther than it's safe to go or contemporary films like Get Out which explores racism and white guilt horror provides a window into our culture and what makes us human. The same can be said of religion. Horror movie buff and religion scholar Brandon Grafius finds common ground between these two seemingly disparate bedfellows--horror and religion--in Lurking under the Surface. What parallels can we draw between The Walking Dead and sacred texrts? How do the stories of Hebrew Christian scriptures and apocalyptic films like A Quiet Place and Bird Box help us find hope when it's in short supply? When we treat them both seriously we see that horror movies and religion lead us through the same sets of questions. Both explore questions of justice hope and our relationship to the world and the cosmos. And both offer us ways to make meaning out of the contradictory pieces of our world--a world filled with so much hope and so many recognizable fears lurking just beneath the surface.

Ghouls Gimmicks and Gold,Horror,The Creature from the Black Lagoon the Tingler the Mole People—they stalked and oozed into audiences’ minds during the era that followed Boris Karloff’s Frankenstein and preceded terrors like Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and Chucky (Child’s Play). Ghouls Gimmicks and Gold pulls off the masks and wipes away the slime to reveal how the monsters that frightened audiences in the 1950s and 1960s—and the movies they crawled and staggered through—reflected fundamental changes in the film industry. Providing the first economic history of the horror film Kevin Heffernan shows how the production distribution and exhibition of horror movies changed as the studio era gave way to the conglomeration of New Hollywood. Heffernan argues that major cultural and economic shifts in the production and reception of horror films began at the time of the 3-d film cycle of 1953–54 and ended with the 1968 adoption of the Motion Picture Association of America’s ratings system and the subsequent development of the adult horror movie—epitomized by Rosemary’s Baby. He describes how this period presented a number of daunting challenges for movie exhibitors: the high costs of technological upgrade competition with television declining movie attendance and a diminishing number of annual releases from the major movie studios. He explains that the production and distribution branches of the movie industry responded to these trends by cultivating a youth audience co-producing features with the film industries of Europe and Asia selling films to television and intensifying representations of sex and violence. Shining through Ghouls Gimmicks and Gold is the delight of the true horror movie buff the fan thrilled to find The Brain that Wouldn’t Die on television at 3 am.
Children Beware!,Horror,How does a culture respond when the limits of childhood become uncertain? The emergence of pre-adolescence in the 1980s which is signified by the new PG-13 rating for film disrupted the established boundaries between childhood and adulthood. The concept of pre-adolescence affected not only America's pillar ideals of family and childhood innocence but also the very foundation of the horror genre's identity its association with maturity and exclusivity. Cultural disputes over the limits of childhood and horror were explicitly articulated in the children's horror trend (1980-1997) a cluster of child-oriented horror titles in film and other media which included Gremlins The Gate the Goosebumps series and others. As the first serious analysis of the children's horror trend with a focus on the significance of ratings this book provides a complete chart of its development while presenting it as a document of American culture's adaptation to pre-adolescence. Each important children's horror title corresponds to a key moment of ideological negotiation cultural power struggles and industrial compromise.

Blood Circuits,Horror,"Argentina is a dominant player in Latin American film known for its documentaries detective films melodramas and auteur cinema. In the past twenty years however the country has also emerged as a notable producer of horror films. Blood Circuits focuses on contemporary Argentine horror cinema and the various ""cinematic pleasures"" it offers national and transnational audiences. Jonathan Risner begins with an overview of horror film culture in Argentina and beyond. He then examines select films grouped according to various criteria: neoliberalism and urban rural and suburban spaces; English-language horror films; gore and affect in punk/horror films; and the legacies of the last dictatorship (1976–1983). While keenly aware of global horror trends Risner argues that these films provide unprecedented ways of engaging with the consequences of authoritarianism and neoliberalism in Argentina."
Carmilla,Horror,"Upon a paper attached to the Narrative which follows Doctor Hesselius has written a rather elaborate note which he accompanies with a reference to his Essay on the strange subject which the MS. illuminates. This mysterious subject he treats in that Essay with his usual learning and acumen and with remarkable directness and condensation. It will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man's collected papers. As I publish the case in this volume simply to interest the ""laity"" I shall forestall the intelligent lady who relates it in nothing; and after due consideration I have determined therefore to abstain from presenting any précis of the learned Doctor's reasoning or extract from his statement on a subject which he describes as ""involving not improbably some of the profoundest arcana of our dual existence and its intermediates."" I was anxious on discovering this paper to reopen the correspondence commenced by Doctor Hesselius so many years before with a person so clever and careful as his informant seems to have been. Much to my regret however I found that she had died in the interval. She probably could have added little to the Narrative which she communicates in the following pages with so far as I can pronounce such conscientious particularity."

Horror Movie,Horror,"A chilling twist on the ""cursed film"" genre from the bestselling author of The Pallbearers Club and The Cabin at the End of the World. In June 1993 a group of young guerilla filmmakers spent four weeks making Horror Movie a notorious disturbing art-house horror flick. The weird part? Only three of the film's scenes were ever released to the public but Horror Movie has nevertheless grown a rabid fanbase. Three decades later Hollywood is pushing for a big budget reboot.

He remembers all too well the secrets buried within the original screenplay the bizarre events of the filming and the dangerous crossed lines on set that resulted in tragedy. As memories flood back in the boundaries between reality and film past and present start to blur. But he's going to help remake the film even if it means navigating a world of cynical producers egomaniacal directors and surreal fan conventions--demons of the past be damned. But at what cost?

Giallo!,Horror,"Italian giallo films have a peculiar allure. Taking their name from the Italian for ""yellow""— reflecting the covers of pulp crime novels—these genre movies were principally produced between 1960 and the late 1970s. These cinematic hybrids of crime horror and detection are characterized by elaborate set-piece murders lurid aesthetics and experimental soundtracks. Using critical frameworks drawn from genre theory reception studies and cultural studies Giallo! traces this historically marginalized genre's journey from Italian cinemas to the global cult-film canon. Through close textual analysis of films including The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963) Blood and Black Lace (1964) The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) The Black Belly of the Tarantula (1971) and The Case of the Bloody Iris (1972) Alexia Kannas considers the rendering of urban space in the giallo and how it expresses a complex and unsettling critique of late modernity."

Discover the thrills and goose bumps that frightened a generation of listeners during radio's Golden Age with 13 hair raising vintage radio scripts featuring stories about Vampires Werewolves Ghosts Severed heads Devil worship Mad scientists and more . By Alonzo Deen Cole the great granddaddy of modern media horror and the creator of network radio's first drama series devoted entirely to the supernatural.

What sets the author's horror plays apart from others of the day is that when the menace is finally unmasked at the climax it's not the disgruntled university scientist or scheming wife but more often than not really truly a sea monster vampire or (as in the opening story ""The Image"") a demonic idol. Alonzo Deen Cole's THE WITCH'S TALE represents the closest we ever came to having a WEIRD TALES radio show. - Bare Bones Magazine I have a copy of this and I want to say that it is worth every penny if you are at all a fan of the macabre.

The Horror at Red Hook,Horror,Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) was an American author of horror fantasy and science fiction known then simply as weird fiction. His major inspiration and invention was cosmic horror: the idea that life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally alien. Those who genuinely reason like his protagonists gamble with sanity. He has developed a cult following for his Cthulhu Mythos a series of loosely interconnected fictions featuring a pantheon of human-nullifying entities as well as the Necronomicon a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore. His works were deeply pessimistic and cynical challenging the values of Enlightenment Romanticist and Christian humanism. Lovecraft's protagonists usually achieve the mirror-opposite of traditional gnosis and mysticism by momentarily glimpsing the horror of ultimate reality. Although Lovecraft's readership was limited during his life his reputation has grown over the decades and he is now commonly regarded as one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century exerting widespread and indirect influence and frequently compared to Edgar Allan Poe.

The Horror of Police,Horror,Unmasks the horrors of a social order reproduced and maintained by the violence of police Year after year the crisis churns: graft and corruption violence and murder riot cops and armored vehicles claim city streets. Despite promises of reform police operate with impunity unaccountable to law. In The Horror of Police Travis Linnemann asks why with this open record of violence and corruption policing remains for so many the best perhaps only means of security in an insecure world. Drawing on the language and texts of horror fiction Linnemann recasts the police not only as self-proclaimed “monster fighters” but as monsters themselves a terrifying force set loose in the world. Purposefully misreading a collection of everyday police stories (TV cop dramas detective fiction news media accounts the direct words of police) not as morality tales of innocence avenged and order restored but as horror Linnemann reveals the monstrous violence at the heart of liberal social order. The Horror of Police shows that police violence is not a deviation but rather a deliberate and permanent fixture of U.S. “law and order.” Only when viewed through the refracted motif of horror stories Linnemann argues can we begin to reckon the limits of police and imagine a world without them.

Fairytale and Gothic Horror,Horror,This book explores the idiosyncratic effects generated as fairytale and gothic horror join clash or merge in cinema. Identifying long-held traditions that have inspired this topical phenomenon the book features close analysis of classical through to contemporary films.

It moves on to investigate films close up locating fairytale horror motifs and themes and a distinctively cinematic gothic horror. At the book’s core are recurring concerns including: the boundaries of the human; rational and irrational forces; fears and dreams; ‘the uncanny’ and transitions between the wilds and civilization. While chronology shapes the book it is thematically driven with an interest in the cultural and political functions of fairytale and gothic horror and the levels of transgression or social conformity at the heart of the films.
Printing Terror,Horror,Printing Terror places horror comics of the Cold War in dialogue with the anxieties of their age. It rejects the narrative of horror comics as inherently and necessarily subversive and explores instead the ways in which these texts manifest white male fears over America's changing sociological landscape. It examines two eras: the pre-CCA period of the 1940s up to 1954 and the post-CCA era to 1975. The book examines each of these periods through the lenses of war gender and race demonstrating that horror comics at this time were centered on white male victimhood and the monstrosity of the gendered and/or racialised other. It is of interest to scholars of horror comics studies and American history.

True Horror Stories,Horror,Since the early 1980s Latin America has seen a definitive shift toward civilian rule. Significant trade fiscal and monetary reforms have accompanied these changes exposing previously statist economies to the forces of the market. Despite the conventional notion that liberal economic reforms sprang out of necessity as opposed to an enlightened set of policy choices the combination of civilian regimes and market-based strategies has proved to be resilient. Economic and political hardships remain including a debt default in Argentina and an attempted coup in Venezuela; however the defining themes of open market and liberal politics still dominate in the region.
Deleuze and the Gynesis of Horror,Horror,Applying Deleuze's schizoanalytic techniques to film theory Deleuze and the Gynesis of Horror demonstrates how an embodied approach to horror film analysis can help us understand how film affects its viewers and distinguish those films which reify static hegemonic “molar” beings from those which prompt fluid nonbinary “molecular” becomings. It does so by analyzing the politics of reproduction in contemporary films such as Ex Machina; Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; Mad Max: Fury Road; the Twilight saga; and the original Alien quadrilogy and its more recent prequels Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Author Sunny Hawkins argues that films which promote a “monstrous philosophy” of qualitative affirmative difference as difference-in-itself and which tend to be more molecular than molar in their expressions can help us trace a “line of flight” from the gender binary in the real world. Deleuze and the Gynesis of Horror demonstrates how the techniques of horror film – editing sound and visual effects lighting and colour camera movement – work in tandem with a film's content to affect the viewer's body in ways that disrupt the sense of self as a whole unified subject with a stable monolithic identity and in some cases can serve to breakdown the binary between self/Other as we come to realize that we are none of us static categorizable beings but are as Henri Bergson said “living things constantly becoming.”
Baroque Aesthetics in Contemporary American Horror,Horror,This book traces a trend that has emerged in recent years within the modern panorama of American horror film and television the concurrent—and often overwhelming—use of multiple stock characters themes and tropes taken from classics of the genre. American Horror Story Insidious and The Conjuring are examples of a filmic tendency to address a series of topics and themes so vast that at first glance each taken separately would seem to suffice for individual films or shows. This book explores this trend in its visible connections with American Horror but also with cultural and artistic movements from outside the US namely Baroque art and architecture Asian Horror and European Horror. It analyzes how these hybrid products are constructed and discusses the socio-political issues that they raise. The repeated and excessive barrage of images tropes and scenarios from distinct subgenres of iconic horror films come together to make up an aesthetic that is referred to in this book as Baroque Horror. In many ways similar to the reactions provoked by the artistic movement of the same name that flourished in the XVII century these productions induce shock awe fear and surprise. Eljaiek-Rodríguez details how American directors and filmmakers construct these narratives using different and sometimes disparate elements that come together to function as a whole terrifying the audience through their frenetic accumulation of images tropes and plot twists. The book also addresses some of the effects that these complex films and series have produced both in the panorama of contemporary horror as well as in how we understand politics in a divisive world that pushes for ideological homogenizations.

Teen Hyde: High School Horror,Horror,Cassidy Hyde is NOT having a good year. Her boyfriend cheated on her killed her best friend's date during homecoming and was then murdered in turn by a serial killer and that's without counting the thing that no one knows about. (But Cassidy doesn't like to think about that.) The point is anyone would be a little depressed and no one can blame her for looking for a little bit of help. That's where Sunshine comes in. This new experimental drug makes Cassidy feel like everything is good and she's the golden girl once again. A little memory loss feels like a small price to pay to get her life back. And the fact that boys are once again going missing (boys who Cassidy does NOT want to remember) has NOTHING to do with anything! Right? Thus begins Chandler Baker's contemporary twist on Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde set in the town of Hollow Pines Texas where high school is truly horrifying.

It Came From the Closet,Horror,“Horror opened me up to new possibilities for survival … I saw power in freakery and transgression and wondered if it could be mine.” The relationship between horror films and the LGBTQ+ community? It’s complicated. Haunted houses forbidden desires and the monstrous can have striking resonance for those who’ve been marginalised. But the genre’s murky history of an alarmingly heterosexual male gaze queer-coded villains and sometimes blatant homophobia is impossible to overlook. There is tension here and there are as many queer readings of horror films as there are queer people. Edited by Joe Vallese and with contributions by writers including Kirsty Logan and Carmen Maria Machado the essays in It Came from the Closet bring the particulars of the writers’ own experiences whether in relation to gender sexuality or both to their unique interpretations of horror films from Jaws to Jennifer’s Body. Exploring a multitude of queer experiences from first kisses and coming out to transition and parenthood this is a varied and accessible collection that leans into the fun of horror while taking its cultural impact and reciprocal relationship to the LGBTQ+ community seriously.

This book introduces three predominant interpretive genres and their implications for biblical understanding. Each contributor identifies their position on the genre or genres of Genesis chapters 1-11 addresses why their interpretation is respectful of and appropriate to the text and contributes examples of its application to a variety of passages. The positions include: Theological History(Genesis can be taken seriously as both history and theology) – defended by James K. Hoffmeier. Proto-History (the early Genesis narratives consist of a variety of literary genres; which nonetheless do not obscure the book's theological teaching) – defended by Gordon J. Wenham. Ancient Historiography (an understanding of Genesis that seeks to reconcile the limitations of its human authors with the nature of it being the Word of God) defended by Kenton L. Sparks. General editor and Old Testament scholar Charles Halton explains the importance of genre and provides historical insight in the introduction and helpful summaries of each position in the conclusion. In the reader-friendly Counterpoints format this book helps readers to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of each view and draw informed conclusions in this much-debated topic.

History and the Contemporary Novel,Historical Fiction,"Cowart presents a study of international historical fiction since World War II with reflections on the affinities between historical and fictional narrative analysis of the basic modes of historical fiction and readings of a number of historical novels including John Barth’s The Sot-Weed Factor Marguerite Yourcenar’s Memoirs of Hadrian Russell Hoban’s Riddley Walker Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa’s The Leopard D. M. Thomas’s The White Hotel William Faulkner’s Go Down Moses and Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose. He proposes recognizing four modes of the historical novel: the past as a ""distant mirror"" of the present fictions whose authors seek to pinpoint the precise historical moment when the modern age or some prominent feature of it came into existence fictions whose authors aspire purely or largely to historical verisimilitude and fictions whose authors reverse history to contemplate utopia and dystopia in the future. Thus historical fiction can be organized under the rubrics: The Distant Mirror; The Turning Point; The Way It Was; and The Way It Will Be. This fourfold schema and his focus on postwar novels set Cowart’s work apart from previous studies which have not devoted adequate space to the contemporary historical novel. Cowart argues that postwar historical fiction merits more extensive treatment because it is the product of an age unique in the annals of history—an age in which history itself may end."

The French Revolution Debate and the British Novel 1790-1814,Historical Fiction,"This study examines how debates about history during the French Revolution informed and changed the nature of the British novel between 1790 and 1814. During these years intersections between history political ideology and fiction as well as the various meanings of the term ""history"" itself were multiple and far reaching. Morgan Rooney elucidates these subtleties clearly and convincingly. While political writers of the 1790s--Burke Price Mackintosh Paine Godwin Wollstonecraft and others--debate the historical meaning of the Glorious Revolution as a prelude to broader ideological arguments about the significance of the past for the present and future novelists engage with this discourse by representing moments of the past or otherwise vying to enlist the authority of history to further a reformist or loyalist agenda. Anti-Jacobin novelists such as Charles Walker Robert Bisset and Jane West draw on Burkean historical discourse to characterize the reform movement as ignorant of the complex operations of historical accretion. For their part reform-minded novelists such as Charlotte Smith William Godwin and Maria Edgeworth travesty Burke's tropes and arguments so as to undermine and then redefine the category of history. As the Revolution crisis recedes new novel forms such as Edgeworth's regional novel Lady Morgan's national tale and Jane Porter's early historical fiction emerge but historical representation--largely the legacy of the 1790s' novel--remains an increasingly pronounced feature of the genre. Whereas the representation of history in the novel Rooney argues is initially used strategically by novelists involved in the Revolution debate it is appropriated in the early nineteenth century by authors such as Edgeworth Morgan and Porter for other often related ideological purposes before ultimately developing into a stable nonpartisan aestheticized feature of the form as practiced by Walter Scott. The French Revolution Debate and the British Novel 1790-1814 demonstrates that the transformation of the novel at this fascinating juncture of British political and literary history contributes to the emergence of the historical novel as it was first realized in Scott's Waverley (1814)."

Inventing Eleanor,Historical Fiction,Eleanor of Aquitaine (1124-1204) queen of France and England and mother of two kings has often been described as one of the most remarkable women of the Middle Ages. Yet her real achievements have been embellished--and even obscured--by myths that have grown up over eight centuries. This process began in her own lifetime as chroniclers reported rumours of her scandalous conduct on crusade and has continued ever since. She has been variously viewed as an adulterous queen a monstrous mother and a jealous murderess but also as a patron of literature champion of courtly love and proto-feminist defender of women's rights. Inventing Eleanor interrogates the myths that have grown up around the figure of Eleanor of Aquitaine and investigates how and why historians and artists have invented an Eleanor who is very different from the 12th-century queen. The book first considers the medieval primary sources and then proceeds to trace the post-medieval development of the image of Eleanor from demonic queen to feminist icon in historiography and the broader culture.

Multicultural Literature for Children and Young Adults,Historical Fiction,There is much discussion of multiculturalism in education. This is especially true of multicultural literature for children and young adults. The rise of multicultural literature is a political rather than a literary movement; it is a movement to claim space in literature and in education for historically marginalized social groups rather than one to renovate the craft of literature itself. Multicultural literature has been closely bound with the cause of multiculturalism in general and thus has been confronted with resistance from conservatives. This book discusses many of the controversial issues surrounding multicultural literature for children and young adults. The volume begins with a look at some of the foundational and theoretical issues related to multicultural literature. The second part of the book addresses issues related to the creation and critique of multicultural literature including the authorship of such works and the role of the reader in determining whether or not a work is multicultural. The third looks at the place of multicultural literature in the education of children and young adults. Throughout its discussion the book makes extensive references to a large body of multicultural fiction and provides a thorough review of research on this important topic.

The authors are postgraduate early career researchers and supervisors who analyse their methodological encounters with the nimble fluid messy and iterative processes of qualitative research.

It rejuvenates the pioneering spirit the sense of mission and innovativeness of qualitative research.

Galdos's Novel of the Historical Imagination,Historical Fiction,The Spanish writer Benito Pérez Galdós (1843-1920) was a prolific novelist and ranks with Balzac and Dickens as a chronicler of nineteenth-century society. His 46 historical novels (the episodios nacionales) dealt with the major events of Spanish history in the first half of the nineteenth century. From about 1870 he began to publish contemporary social novels and in 1881 with La desheredada he inaugurated what he himself saw as a new style of writing. The novels from 1881 to 1915 his serie contemporánea are the subject of this study. Professor Bly argues that in them Galdós created a special type of historical novel which by drawing subtle parallels between fictional action and political events allegorised the political history of the recent Spanish past. In the earlier novels of the series the relationship between the fiction and its contemporary background has an allegorical dimension. Historical detail both provides a precise setting for the narrative and indicates that the fiction represents the national reality while the leading fictional characters symbolize public figures. The later novels however increasingly show disenchantment with Spanish politics reflected in a diminishing use of historical material and in the emergence of characters who renounce social involvement in favour of the almost mystical pursuit of Christian values. In arguing for this approach to the serie contemporánea Peter Bly offers perceptive interpretations of all the novels but devotes particular attention to the masterpieces La de Bringas Fortunata y Jacinta and Miau. Because the novels relate to the major political trends and events of the period a brief historical survey of the years 1860-1910 is provided as an appendix.
Fictions of Culture,Historical Fiction,This volume has two related aims. The first is to honor Walter H.

Sokel has been a distinguished teacher and researcher at various American universities including Columbia Stanford and the University of Virginia. He has specialized in the study of German intellectual History Expressionism and Franz Kafka.

Wheat,Historical Fiction,Wheat! The Reminiscences of Porter Rockwell is a work of historical fiction meaning that some of it is history and some of it is fiction and some of it is both history and fiction. I (Wally Foote) tell the story from the first-person point of view to lend it authenticity and also give it the ring of truth which it mostly is. Why did I write this book? First because I don't believe any writer has yet done justice to Porter's story and second even if some say the story has been effectively told it's never (until now) been told by me! Porter Rockwell has long been a hero of mine. On the list of colorful characters of the Old West I find him to be one of the more colorful. At the same time he is one who is often neglected or it seems to me under-appreciated. With his unparalleled tracking ability his proficiency in the use of weapons his incredible horsemanship and super-human tenacity and endurance he stands apart from many others who thrived on the American frontier. As he demonstrated many times he was also completely and absolutely human. This side of him likewise has its appeal. To the best of my knowledge the dates and the place names I've included are accurate. With the exception of one or two the people I name are real or are at least known to history.

Most of the details I provide came directly from an accepted historical source or were suggested by one except for a few little dainties I created out of whole cloth. The more times I tell these parts the truer they seem.

On the Field of Glory,Historical Fiction,"From Reviews of Reviews Volume 34: “The Field of Glory"" is full of the elements which give perennial charm to the romances of Scott and Dumas. In this book the novelist transports us to the heroic days when Poland under John Sobieski rode forth to save Christendom from the Infidel who but for the Poles would have captured Vienna. “The Field of Glory"" gives us a vivid picture of the bloodshed and turmoil of the seventeenth century in the territories which formed the rampart of Christendom. It enables us of the West to understand why the Poles think so much of themselves and how bitterly they resent their present position. The Pole in his own estimation at least and in that of the Turks was in those days the finest fighting man in Europe. The borderland of Christian and Paynim was the natural seed-plot for deeds of derring-do. “The Field of Glory"" reminds us of “Ivanhoe "" and “ The Talisman” and the three burly brothers are an Eastern somewhat brutalized variant upon the three musketeers of Dumas's immortal romance. The names are somewhat uncouth and Panna as a substitute for Countess is unfamiliar to our ears. But despite these drawbacks “The Field of Glory ” is a good stirring romance of Polish chivalry."

Quo Vadis: a Narrative of the Time of Nero,Historical Fiction,"At a time when the state of Poland was constantly undergoing political turmoil Henryk Sienkiewicz wasn't afraid to ruffle feathers. Having already achieved success in his career around the end of the 19th century the Polish journalist negatively portrayed the Teutonic Order at a time in which his audience lived under German rule. At the same time he meticulously included historical language in his works a sort of celebration of authenticity and the past. He would earn a Nobel Prize in 1905 for ""outstanding merits as an epic writer."" Sienkiewicz mastered historical novels that vividly put readers in places as distinct as 17th century Poland and Ancient Rome.

Douglas and more recently Christ the Lord by Anne Rice and Stone Tables by Orson Scott Card The Masada Scroll is bold and reverent with deep and important meaning for today's world. At the heart of this timely novel is the discovery of a previously unknown gospel that predates the four gospels of the New Testament. The scroll introduces a mysterious symbol that combines the Star of David the Cross of Christianity and the Crescent and Star of Islam. None of these symbols existed at the time the Gospel was written adding to the mystery that Michael Flannery an Irish priest must unravel. Flannery discovers that the symbol represents the Trevia Dei or Three Paths to God. At the heart of Jesus' message is the unity of the paths that lead to God. The true meaning of Trevia Dei has become perverted over the centuries turning the message of unity into a single path to salvation. But there are those who do not want the message of this wonderful book of light and love brought to our troubled world who have chosen to separate rather than unite God's children. The Masada Scroll is the story of the new Apostles who struggle to bring the simple message of Jesus back into a world desperate for joy. The Masada Scroll is a tale of the timeless quest for spiritual truth and redemption. It is a story that will change the way you look at the world...and your own heart.

Shadows on the Past,Historical Fiction,Studying popular Hollywood films from Gone With the Wind to Reds and such distinguished European films as La Marseillaise and The Rise to Power of Louis XIV Leger Grindon examines how historical fiction films interpret the present through a representation of the past. The historical fiction film is characterized by a set of motives and Grindon argues deserves to be considered a genre unto itself. Appropriation of historical events can insinuate a film's authority of its subject veil an intention provide an escape into nostalgia or direct a search for knowledge and origins. Utilizing the past as a way of responding to social conflicts in the present Grindon shows how the genre promotes a political agenda superseding the influence of scholarship on the public's perception and interpretation of history. In the series Culture and the Moving Image edited by Robert Sklar.

The Fateful Lightning,Historical Fiction,NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From Jeff Shaara comes the riveting final installment in the Civil War series that began with A Blaze of Glory and continued in A Chain of Thunder and The Smoke at Dawn. November 1864: As the Civil War rolls into its fourth bloody year the tide has turned decidedly in favor of the Union. A grateful Abraham Lincoln responds to Ulysses S. Grant’s successes by bringing the general east promoting Grant to command the entire Union war effort while William Tecumseh Sherman now directs the Federal forces that occupy all of Tennessee. In a massive surge southward Sherman conquers the city of Atlanta sweeping aside the Confederate army under the inept leadership of General John Bell Hood. Pushing through northern Georgia Sherman’s legendary March to the Sea shoves away any Rebel presence and by Christmas 1864 the city of Savannah falls into the hands of “Uncle Billy.” Now there is but one direction for Sherman to go. In his way stands the last great hope for the Southern cause General Joseph E. Johnston. In the concluding novel of his epic Civil War tetralogy Jeff Shaara tells the dramatic story of the final eight months of battle from multiple perspectives: the commanders in their tents making plans for total victory as well as the ordinary foot soldiers and cavalrymen who carried out their orders until the last alarum sounded. Through Sherman’s eyes we gain insight into the mind of the general who vowed to “make Georgia howl” until it surrendered. In Johnston we see a man agonizing over the limits of his army’s power and accepting the burden of leading the last desperate effort to ensure the survival of the Confederacy. The Civil War did not end quietly. It climaxed in a storm of fury that lay waste to everything in its path. The Fateful Lightning brings to life those final brutal bloody months of fighting with you-are-there immediacy grounded in the meticulous research that readers have come to expect from Jeff Shaara. Praise for The Fateful Lightning “Powerful and emotional . . . highly recommended.”—Historical Novels Review “Outstanding . . . Shaara combines his extensive knowledge of military history with his consummate skill as a storyteller.”—Booklist “Readers . . . looking for an absorbing novel will be well rewarded.”—The Clarion-Ledger “A great accomplishment and a more than fitting conclusion to Shaara’s work on the Civil War.”—Bookreporter

English Drama,Drama,What were the causes of Restoration drama's licentiousness? How did the elegantly-turned comedy of Congreve become the pointed satire of Fielding? And how did Sheridan and Goldsmith reshape the materials they inherited? In the first account of the entire period for more than a decade Richard Bevis argues that none of these questions can be answered without an understanding of Augustan and Georgian history. The years between 1660 and 1789 saw considerable political and social upheaval which is reflected in the eclectic array of dramatic forms that is Georgian theatre's essential characteristic.

Reconstructing Satyr Drama,Drama,The origins of satyr drama and particularly the reliability of the account in Aristotle remains contested and several of this volume’s contributions try to make sense of the early relationship of satyr drama to dithyramb and attempt to place satyr drama in the pre-Classical performance space and traditions. What is not contested is the relationship of satyr drama to tragedy as a required cap to the Attic trilogy. Here however how Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides (to whom one complete play and the preponderance of the surviving fragments belong) envisioned the relationship of satyr drama to tragedy in plot structure setting stage action and language is a complex subject tackled by several contributors. The playful satyr chorus and the drunken senility of Silenos have always suggested some links to comedy and later to Atellan farce and phlyax. Those links are best examined through language passages in later Greek and Roman writers and in art. The purpose of this volume is probe as many themes and connections of satyr drama with other literary genres as well as other art forms putting satyr drama on stage from the sixth century BC through the second century AD. The editors and contributors suggest solutions to some of the controversies but the volume shows as much that the field of study is vibrant and deserves fuller attention.
Drama and Politics in the English Civil War,Drama,In 1642 an ordinance closed the theatres of England. Critics and historians have assumed that the edict was to be firm and inviolate. Susan Wiseman challenges this assumption and argues that the period 1640 to 1660 was not a gap in the production and performance of drama nor a blank space between 'Renaissance drama' and the 'Restoration stage'. Rather throughout the period writers focused instead on a range of dramas with political perspectives from republican to royalist. This group included the short pamphlet dramas of the 1640s and the texts produced by the writers of the 1650s such as William Davenant Margaret Cavendish and James Shirley. In analysing the diverse forms of dramatic production of the 1640s and 1650s Wiseman reveals the political and generic diversity produced by the changes in dramatic production and offers insights into the theatre of the Civil War.

The Vedic Core of Human History,Drama,The origin of world civilization can be traced to the Indus Valley cradle where brilliant and original thinkers made groundbreaking discoveries. The history of these discoveries is recorded in the vast Sanskrit literature. In this study author M. K. Agarwal explores the cultural and historical significance of the region. He explores Indus Valley culture which encouraged creative thoughtas opposed to the Abrahamic faiths which herded followers into dogmatic thinking. He holds that these religions prospered because of their unfettered hatred of the Vedic-Hindu-Buddhist peoples who were demonized as pagans to be murdered tortured raped enslaved and robbed. He also considers the achievements of that culture such as the creation of the most affluent most scientifically advanced and most spiritual of all societies with archeological moorings that can be traced back to 8000 BC. No other region can even come close to transforming people and culture like the Indus Valley but the worlds Vedic roots have been ignored shunned and covered up. Uncover the history that has been lost and develop a deeper appreciation for the true cradle of human civilization with The Vedic Core of Human History.

Nietzsche Wagner Europe,Drama,Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) supported the unification of Europe and reflected on this like few other philosophers before or after him. Many of his works are concerned with the present state and future of European culture and humanity. Resisting the “nationalist nonsense” and “politics of dissolution” of his day he advocated the birth of “good Europeans” i.e. “supra-national” individuals and the “amalgamation of nations.” Nietzsche Wagner Europe analyzes the development of Friedrich Nietzsche’s ideal of European culture based on his musical aesthetics. It does so against the background of contemporary searches for a wider cultural meaning beyond Europe’s economic-political union. The book claims that Nietzsche always propagated the “aestheticization” of Europe but that his view on how to achieve this changed as a result of his dramatically altering philosophy of music. The main focus is on Nietzsche’s passion for and later aversion to Wagner’s music and in direct connection with this his surprising embrace of Italian operas as new forms of “Dionysian” music and of Goethe as a model of “Good Europeanism.”
European Romanticism,Drama,Romanticism was always culturally diverse. Though English-language anthologies have previously tended to see Romanticism as predominantly British the term itself actually originated in Germany where it became the banner of a Europe-wide movement involving the profound intellectual and aesthetic changes which we now associate with modernity. This anthology is the first to place British Romanticism within a comprehensive and multi-lingual European context showing how ideas and writers interconnected across national and linguistic boundaries. By reprinting everything in the original languages together with an English translation of all non-English material in parallel on the opposite page it offers a new intellectual map of Romanticism. Material is thematically arranged as follows: - Art & Aesthetics - The Self - History - Language - Hermeneutics & Theology - Nature - The Exotic - Science While focusing on European texts the inclusion of essays on their North American and Japanese reception means that Romanticism can be seen as a global phenomenon influencing a surprising number of the ways in which the modern world sees itself.

Trials and Tribunals in the Dramas of Heinrich Von Kleist,Drama,What makes the trial so appealing as dramatic form? Why do we watch? Is it simply the quest for truth and justice? Or is it much more than that? From the time of Sophocles the court has fascinated audiences and dramatists alike. Kleist is no exception as each of his dramas and many of his stories and anecdotes contain a trial of some sort from its most primitive form of hand-to-hand combat in the duel to more conventional legal proceedings in secular military and ecclesiastical courts. At trial we desire whether consciously or unconsciously to have our own system of beliefs and behaviours affirmed rather than to attempt to achieve justice: self interest prevails at the expense of truth and equity. The focus of this book is the tension between the restoration of dike the balance of natural order and the pursuit of truth and justice as impetus behind the trial. With recourse to the concept of legal instrumentalism which underscores this preference for order over justice in both the law and literature the author examines Kleist's dramas to determine the extent to which those individuals in positions of power are able to manipulate the proceedings seeking not justice and truth but rather the validation of their own particular version of order. The trial a tool generally thought to be designed to discover truth and to mete out justice is used instead in the hands of the powerful as an instrument of control and degradation.
The Central Self,Drama,In this closely argued book Dr Ball is concerned to analyse the imaginative process of self-understanding which emerged as a characteristic feature of English Romantic poetry and acquiring fresh creative force in the Victorian period has been transmitted to our own times as a determining principle of the contemporary imagination. Dr Ball relates her discussion to the distinction between the poet speaking directly in his own voice and the impulse to dramatised utterance – the two modes of poetic expression conveniently summed up in Keats's contrasting terms 'egotistical sublime' and 'chameleon'. She shows how these 'polar' tendencies co-exist fruitfully in the work of Wordsworth Coleridge Byron Shelley and Keats and from this standpoint supplies a coherent appreciation of the little-regarded plays written by these poets. Turning to Victorian critics and poets Dr Ball considers how the Romantic inheritance fared at their hands. She sees in the poets notably Tennyson Arnold Browning and Hopkins a vital link by which the Romantic commitment to the agency of self-consciousness has been carried forward to the twentieth century and concludes with a brief sketch of the creative role of self-exploration in T. S. Eliot and W. B. Yeats.
God's Agents,Drama,"The British and Foreign Bible Society is one of the most illustrious Christian charities in the United Kingdom. Founded by evangelicals in the early nineteenth century and inspired by developments in printing technology its goal has always been to make Bibles universally available. Over the past several decades though Bible Society has faced a radically different world especially in its work in England. Where the Society once had a grateful and engaged reading public it now faces apathy—even antipathy—for its cause. These days it seems no one in England wants a Bible and no one wants other people telling them they should: religion is supposed to be a private matter. Undeterred these Christians attempt to spark a renewed interest in the Word of God. They’ve turned away from publishing and toward publicity to ""make the Bible heard."" God’s Agents is a study of how religion goes public in today’s world. Based on over three years of anthropological research Matthew Engelke traces how a small group of socially committed Christians tackle the challenge of publicity within what they understand to be a largely secular culture. In the process of telling their story he offers an insightful new way to think about the relationships between secular and religious formations: our current understanding of religion needs to be complemented by greater attention to the process of generating publicity. Engelke argues that we are witnessing the dynamics of religious publicity which allows us to see the ways in which conceptual divides such as public/private religious/secular and faith/knowledge are challenged and redefined by social actors on the ground."
Everyday Arias,Drama,Paul Atkinson explores the remarkable world of opera through his fieldwork with the internationally known Welsh National Opera company. In order to show us how cultural phenomena are produced and enacted he takes us on stage and behind the scenes into the collective social action that goes into the realization of an opera. The author demonstrates how artistic interpretation is translated into the routine work of the rehearsal studio and the theatre and how producers negotiate a practical reality with her or his performers to ultimately create extraordinary performances through the mundane everyday work that makes them possible. The author calls for a sustained investigation of cultural phenomena not based solely on textual analysis but on the importance of collective work and social organization. Atkinson's work will appeal to anthropologists and sociologists who study the performance arts as well as to those engaged in theatre arts opera and music.
Tribes and Territories in the 21st Century,Drama,The ‘tribes and territories’ metaphor for the cultures of academic disciplines and their roots in different knowledge characteristics has been used by those interested in university life and work since the early 1990s. This book draws together research data and theory to show how higher education has gone through major change since then and how social theory has evolved in parallel. Together these changes mean there is a need to re-theorise academic life in a way which reflects changed contexts in universities in the twenty-first century and so a need for new metaphors. Using a social practice approach the editors and contributors argue that disciplines are alive and well but that in a turbulent environment where many other forces conditioning academic practices exist their influence is generally weaker than before. However the social practice approach adopted in the book highlights how this influence is contextually contingent – how disciplines are deployed in different ways for different purposes and with varying degrees of purchase. This important book pulls together the latest thinking on the subject and offers a new framework for conceptualising the influences on academic practices in universities. It brings together a distinguished group of scholars from across the world to address questions such as: Have disciplines been displaced by inter-disciplinarity having outlived their usefulness? Have other forces acting on the academy pushed disciplines into the background as factors shaping the practices of academics and students there? How significant are disciplinary differences in teaching and research practices? What is their significance in other areas of work in universities? This timely book addresses a pressing concern in modern education and will be of great interest to university professionals managers and policy-makers in the field of higher education.

Conhecido inicialmente por ""Margaret Hale"" teve seu título alterado por pressão de seus editores para ""North and South"" demonstrando melhor o tema geral do livro: o contraste existente entre o modo de vida da Inglaterra industrializada do norte e da Inglaterra rural e inocente do sul em uma época fortemente marcada pela revolução industrial do século 19. Quando publicado como livro em 1855 esta incluiu um prefácio afirmando que por causa das restrições do formato da revista a autora foi incapaz de desenvolver a história como desejava e deste modo ""várias passagens curtas foram inseridas e vários novos capítulos adicionados"". O livro é um romance social que tenta demonstrar a vida e os conflitos existentes no norte industrializado dos meados do século 19 através das impressões de uma jovem nascida nas regiões rurais da Inglaterra. A heroína da história Margaret Hale é filha de um ministro religioso que se muda para a cidade fictícia de Milton cujo modelo era a cidade de Manchester onde Elizabeth Gaskell morou em companhia de seu marido e trabalhou em ações filantrópicas junto aos pobres da cidade e conheceu de perto as misérias das áreas industriais. A mudança no estilo de vida choca Margaret que simpatiza profundamente com a pobreza e as dificuldades vividas pelos trabalhadores urbanos. Após um encontro com um grupo de grevistas no qual Margaret tenta proteger Thornton da violência dos manifestantes os dois se apaixonam entretanto uma série de conflitos e desencontros até o derradeiro reencontro onde cada um dos personagens terá que rever seus preconceitos chegando à madura aceitação de si mesmos e de seus sentimentos."

Chosen from a wide variety of well-received dramas of the period each play represents the traditions and changes in a particular subgenre: regional theater proletarian theater women's theater history plays and experimental theater. Xiaomei Chen's wide-ranging and perceptive introduction locates the plays in the political and cultural history of modern China to demonstrate the interrelationship between theater history society and everyday experience. She highlights the origin and development of the different sub-genres and outlines critical approaches from numerous fields including gender studies performance studies subaltern studies and comparative cultural studies. Quite apart from their importance as theater these plays are crucial for a fully rounded understanding of the cultural dynamics involved in the transition from Maoist to post-Mao China from socialist realist drama to the post-socialist response to a market economy and a society in flux.
The Drama of Social Life,Drama,These essays explore the many ways theater and dramaturgy are used to shape the everyday experience of people in mass societies. Young argues that technologies combine with the world of art music and cinema to shape consciousness as a commodity and to fragment social relations in the market as well as in religion and politics. He sees the central problem of post-modern society as how to live in a world constructed by human beings without nihilism on the one hand or repressive dogmatism on the other. Young argues that in advanced monopoly capitalism dramaturgy has replaced coercion as the management tool of choice for the control of consumers workers voters and state functionaries. Young calls this process the “colonization of desire.” Desire is colonized by the use of dramaturgy mass media and the various forms of art in order to generate consumers vesting desire in ownership and display rather than in interpersonal relationships with profound consequence for marriage kinship friendship and community. While Young focuses his critique on capitalist societies undergoing great changes he insists that the same developments are to be found in bureaucratically organized socialist societies. The Drama of Social Life is of interest to those who study theories of moral development cultural studies the uses of leisure politics or simply the uses of “make believe.” It is intended for the informed lay public as much as for social psychologists.

Theatrocracy,Drama,"Theatrocracy is a book about the power of the theatre how it can affect the people who experience it and the societies within which it is embedded. It takes as its model the earliest theatrical form we possess complete plays from the classical Greek theatre of the fifth century BCE and offers a new approach to understanding how ancient drama operated in performance and became such an influential social cultural and political force inspiring and being influenced by revolutionary developments in political engagement and citizen discourse. Key performative elements of Greek theatre are analyzed from the perspective of the cognitive sciences as embodied live enacted events with new approaches to narrative space masks movement music words emotions and empathy. This groundbreaking study combines research from the fields of the affective sciences – the study of human emotions – including cognitive theory neuroscience psychology artificial intelligence psychiatry and cognitive archaeology with classical theatre and performance studies. This book revisits what Plato found so unsettling about drama – its ability to produce a theatrocracy a ""government"" of spectators – and argues that this was not a negative but an essential element of Athenian theatre. It shows that Athenian drama provided a place of alterity where audiences were exposed to different viewpoints and radical perspectives. This perspective was and is vital in a freethinking democratic society where people are expected to vote on matters of state. In order to achieve this goal the theatre offered a dissociative and absorbing experience that enhanced emotionality deepened understanding and promoted empathy. There was and still is an urgent imperative for theatre."

Tragedy's End,Drama,Euripides is a notoriously problematic and controversial playwright whose innovations according to Nietzsche brought Greek tragedy to an early death. Dunn here argues that the infamous and artificial endings in Euripides deny the viewer access to a stable or authoritative reading of the play while innovations in plot and ending opened tragedy up to a medley of comic parodic and narrative impulses. Part One explores the dramatic and metadramatic uses of novel closing gestures such as aetiology closing prophecy exit lines of the chorus and deus ex machina. Part Two shows how experimentation in plot and ending reinforce one another in Hippolytus Trojan Women and Heracles. Part Three argues that in three late plays Helen Orestes and Phoenician Women Euripides devises radically new and untragic ways of representing and understanding human experience. Tragedy's End is the first comprehensive study of closure in classical literature and will be of interest to a range of students and scholars.

The principles of dramafi art are unchanging through the ages the same to-day in Paris or in New York that the: were in Athens twenty-four hundred years ago. They are to be deduced from the trag dies of Sophocles as clearly as from the tragedies of Shakespeare from the comedim II Moliere as obviously as from the comedies of leasing and Goldoni and Augier; and the are all the result of the fact that a dramatist always composes his plays with the deair and the intent that they shall be performed by actors in a theater and before an and ence. He takes thought of the performers of his own time and city; and Sopho an Moliere while they were creating characters for the appreciation of posterity were ale preparing parts for contemporary performers in whom they had confidence. He adjust the stories he tells on the stage to the physical conditions of the only playhouse wit which he is familiar. And he feels constrained always to choose the kind of story whio will arouse and retain the interests of his contemporaries in his own country giving n thought to the possible likings of any other audience either abroad or in the future.

The Irish Drama of Europe from Yeats to Beckett,Drama,This study provides a European perspective on the drama of Yeats and of the Irish playwrights – Wilde and Synge O'Casey and Beckett – who share in the achievement of creating a modern 'drama of the interior'. Professor Worth traces in particular the influence of Maeterlinck examining his 'static drama' in some detail. A dominant theme is the importance of total theatre techniques to the playwrights of the interior from Wilde in Salomé to O'Casey in plays like Cock-a-Doodle Dandy. Yeats is seen as the great pioneer assimilating inspiration from the French with Arthur Symons as guide from Synge from Gordon Craig and from the No drama and evolving a modern technique for a drama of complex self-consciousness.

Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre,Drama,This eye-opening study draws attention to the largely neglected form of the early modern prologue. Reading the prologue in performed as well as printed contexts Douglas Bruster and Robert Weimann take us beyond concepts of stability and autonomy in dramatic beginnings to reveal the crucial cultural functions performed by the prologue in Elizabethan England. While its most basic task is to seize the attention of a noisy audience the prologue's more significant threshold position is used to usher spectators and actors through a rite of passage. Engaging competing claims expectations and offerings the prologue introduces authorizes and critically straddles the worlds of the actual theatrical event and the 'counterfeit' world on stage. In this way prologues occupy a unique and powerful position between two orders of cultural practice and perception. Close readings of prologues by Shakespeare and his contemporaries including Marlowe Peele and Lyly demonstrate the prologue's role in representing both the world in the play and playing in the world. Through their detailed examination of this remarkable form and its functions the authors provide a fascinating perspective on early modern drama a perspective that enriches our knowledge of the plays' socio-cultural context and their mode of theatrical address and action.

Character Treatment in the Mediaeval Drama (Classic Reprint),Drama,"Excerpt from Character Treatment in the Mediaeval Drama A word on the nomenclature to be used in this Essay. It will be understood from the purpose in view that we are engaged with the beginning of an art - form and consequently are long antecedent to the date of precise terminology and defined technique. The drama with which we have to do is in its formative period in process of growth. It is obvious then that terms which have a very definite meaning when speaking of the classical drama must be employed loosely and in some instances merely analogically when reference is to early and imperfect forms. The classical terms ""tragoedia"" and ""comoedia"" are not normally applicable to the religious play until the Renaissance influences come in toward the end of the fifteenth century. In fact their Mediaeval sense as Mr. Chambers notes (The Mediaeval Stage Vol. II p. 103 ) implies nothing distinctly dramatic. Cloetta in the first volume of his work on the history of Mediaeval and Renaissance literature (Komodie und Tragodie im Mittelalter) has collected and analyzed in historical order descriptions of comedy and tragedy which have little in common with Aristotle's definitions. Few if any of the Mediaeval authors that the historian cites can be said to have in mind the purely professional or academic connotation of the words in the sense that Aristotle had; rather it was with the popular or analogical import of the terms that they were concerned. Chaucer's familiar reference in the Miller's Tale for instance makes no pretention either to technical accuracy or completeness. Nobody would impute to Dante ignorance of the classical definition of tragedy and comedy his analogical use of the words however may be taken as illustrative of Mediaeval usage generally. ""Est comedia genus quoddam poeticae narrationis ab omnibus aliis differens. Differt ergo a tragoedia per hoc quod tragoedia in principio est admirabilis et quieta in fine sine exitu foetida et horribilis... Comoedia vero inchoat asperitatcra alicujus rei sed ejus materia prospere terminatur etc."" Conformably with this distinction he called his own poem a comedy and the Aeneid a tragedy (Cf. Inferno XX 113; DuMeril Les Origines Latines du Theatre Moderne pp. 32-33.) It will be well to bear in mind this breadth of meaning given the specific terms ""tragoedia"" and ""comoedia"" if one would understand in what sense such words as drama dramatist poet play scene act climax etc. are applicable to the Mediaeval playwright and his work.

Radio Drama,Drama,Radio Drama brings together the practical skills needed for radio drams such as directing writing and sound design with media history and communication theory. Challenging the belief that sound drama is a 'blind medium' Radio Drama shows how experimentation in radio narrative has blurred the dividing line between fiction and reality in modern media. Using extracts from scripts and analysing radio broadcasts from America Britain Canada and Australia the book explores the practicalities of producing drama for radio.

Shakespeare's Drama of Exile,Drama,Exile defines the Shakespearean canon from The Two Gentlemen of Verona to The Two Noble Kinsmen . This book traces the influences on the drama of exile examining the legal context of banishment (pursued against Catholics gypsies and vagabonds) in early modern England; the self-consciousness of exile as an amatory trope; and the discourses by which exile could be reshaped into comedy or tragedy. Across genres Shakespeare's plays reveal a fascination with exile as the source of linguistic crisis shaped by the utterance of that word 'Banished'.
A Beggar's Art,Drama,In the opening decades of the twentieth century in Japan practically every major author wrote plays that were published and performed. The plays were seen not simply as the emergence of a new literary form but as a manifestation of modernity itself transforming the stage into a site for the exploration of new ideas and ways of being. A Beggar’s Art is the first book in English to examine the full range of early twentieth-century Japanese drama. Accompanying his study M. Cody Poulton provides his translations of representative one-act plays. Poulton looks at the emergence of drama as a modern literary and artistic form and chronicles the creation of modern Japanese drama as a reaction to both traditional (particularly kabuki) dramaturgy and European drama. Translations and productions of the latter became the model for the so-called New Theater (shingeki) where the question of how to be both modern and Japanese at the same time was hotly contested. Following introductory essays on the development of Japanese drama from the 1880s to the early 1930s are translations of nine seminal one-act plays by nine dramatists including two women Okada Yachiyo and Hasegawa Shigure. The subject matter of these plays is that of modern drama everywhere: discord between men and women between parents and children and the resulting disintegration of marriages and families. Both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat make their appearances; modern pretensions are lampooned and modern predicaments lamented in equal measure. Realism (as evidenced in the plays of Kikuchi Kan and Tanaka Chikao) prevails as the mode of modernity but other styles are presented: the symbolism of Izumi Kyoka Suzuki Senzaburo’s brittle melodrama Kubota Mantaro’s minimalistic lyricism Akita Ujaku’s politically incisive expressionism and even a proto-absurdist work by Japan’s master of prewar drama Kishida Kunio. With its combination of new translations and informative and theoretically engaging essays A Beggar’s Art will prove invaluable for students and researchers in world theater and Japanese studies particularly those with an interest in modern Japanese literature and culture.
